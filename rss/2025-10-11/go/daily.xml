&lt;p&gt;Organize your photos &amp;amp; videos, chats &amp;amp; messages, location history, social media content, contacts, and more into a single cohesive timeline on your own computer where you can keep them alive forever.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Timelinize lets you import your data from practically anywhere: your computer, phone, online accounts, GPS-enabled radios, various apps and programs, contact lists, cameras, and more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://discord.gg/C9dCnTW6qV"&gt;Join our Discord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to discuss!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;[!NOTE] I am looking for a better name for this project. If you have an idea for a good name that is short, relevant, unique, and available, &lt;a href="https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/issues/2"&gt;I'd love to hear it!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These were captured using a dev repository of mine filled with a subset of my real data, so I've run Timelinize in obfuscation mode: images and videos are blurred (except profile pictures---need to fix that); names, identifiers, and locations around sensitive areas are all randomized, and text has been replaced with random words so that the string is about the same length.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(I hope to make a video tour soon.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please remember this is an early alpha preview, and the software is very much evolving and improving. And you can help!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/thead&gt;

   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/293cbe57-ac75-4c4b-b78a-b75f6d442d99" alt="WIP Dashboard" /&gt; WIP dashboard. &lt;strong&gt;Very&lt;/strong&gt; WIP. The bubble chart is particularly interesting as it shows you what kinds of data are most common at which times of day throughout the years.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01f808c4-7b0e-4ad0-b12a-6398f6321272" alt="Timeline view" /&gt; The classic timeline view is a combination of all data grouped by types and time segments for reconstructing a day or other custom time period.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f5671c-df85-4af5-9f67-6358e7489442" alt="Item view" /&gt; Viewing an item shows all the information about it, regardless of type: text, photo, live photo, video, location, etc.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf2482e-58a5-434f-a0d2-f9b1274af106" alt="File picker" /&gt; I had to make a custom file picker since browser APIs are too limiting. This is how you'll import most of your data into your timeline, but this flow is being revised soon.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/051031c1-0659-4388-b01f-475bb4d24490" alt="3D map" /&gt; The large map view is capable of 3D exploration, showing your memories right where they happened with a color-coded path that represents time.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ddbe3cd-4bdc-4d3a-be92-d9c41e29ee1b" alt="Map showing non-geolocated data" /&gt; Because Timelinize is entity-aware and supports multiple data sources, it can show data on a map even if it doesn't have geolocation information. That's what the gray dots or pins represent. In this example, a text message was received while at church, even though it doesn't have any geolocation info associated with it directly.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832c6bce-029c-4abf-943e-84253458a9f7" alt="Entities" /&gt; Timelinize treats entities (people, pets/animals, organizations, etc.) as first-class data points which you can filter and organize.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/932259b1-fc1d-40bc-b27d-a58e37537c4c" alt="Merge entities" /&gt; Timelinize will automatically recognize the same entity across data sources with enough information, but if it isn't possible automatically, you can manually merge entities with a click.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0973df3c-eba9-49b8-b369-0e44f4120c37" alt="Conversations" /&gt; Conversations are aggregated across data sources that have messaging capabilities. They become emergent from the database by querying relationships between items and entities.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ece383-6702-47ed-8f11-6c95af0cc3de" alt="Conversation view" /&gt; In this conversation view, you can see messages exchanged with this person across both Facebook and SMS/text message are displayed together. Reactions are also supported.&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe89db8e-66b1-4854-9d47-a774bf20961f" alt="Gallery" /&gt; A gallery displays photos and videos, but not just those in your photo library: it includes pictures and memes sent via messages, photos and videos uploaded to social media, and any other photos/videos in your data. You can always filter to drill down.&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/tbody&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://timelinize.com/docs/data-preparation"&gt;Obtain your data.&lt;/a&gt; This usually involves exporting your data from apps, online accounts, or devices. For example, requesting an archive from Google Takeout. (Apple iCloud, Facebook, Twitter/X, Strava, Instagram, etc. all offer similar functionality for GDPR compliance.) Do this early/soon, because some services take days to provide your data.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Import your data using Timelinize. You don't need to extract or decompress .tar or .zip archives; Timelinize will attempt to recognize your data in its original format and folder structure. All the data you import is indexed in a SQLite database and stored on disk organized by date -- no obfuscation or proprietary formats; you can simply browse your files if you wish.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Explore and organize! Timelinize has a UI that portrays data using various projections and filters. It can recall moments from your past and help you view your life more comprehensively. (It's a great living family history tool.)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 1-3 as often as desired. Timelinize will skip any existing data that is the same and only import new content. You could do this every few weeks or months for busy accounts that are most important to you.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION] Timelinize is in active development and is still considered unstable. The schema is still changing, necessitating starting over from a clean slate when updating. Always keep your original source data. Expect to delete and recreate your timelines as you upgrade during this alpha development period.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Download and run&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a href="https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/releases/latest"&gt;latest release&lt;/a&gt; for your platform.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See the website for &lt;a href="https://timelinize.com/docs/install"&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Develop&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See our &lt;a href="https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/"&gt;project wiki&lt;/a&gt; for instructions on &lt;a href="https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/wiki/Develop"&gt;compiling from source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Command line interface&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Timelinize has a symmetric HTTP API and CLI. When an HTTP API endpoint is created in the code, it automatically adds to the command line as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;timelinize help&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;go run main.go help&lt;/code&gt; if you're running from source) to view the list of commands, which are also HTTP endpoints. JSON or form inputs are converted to command line args/flags that represent the JSON schema or form fields.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;!-- &lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;Wails UI info (no longer used)&lt;/summary&gt;

## Wails v2 (native GUI) info

The last commit that used Wails (v2) was b9b80838b2b92501139f2f0c5fab63921a7e6502.
That can be used as a reference if we ever switch back to Wails. The last working
commit that had Wails that was released as a dev preview was
bcb0f732e01e5b0e34a142a35b658a1f328c4c6d.

In July-August 2023 we transitioned away from Wails and went to a client/server
model for stability and flexibility. Wails itself was great, the main problem
was the poor performance of Webkit2GTK, even on Mac it was pretty bad (frequent
crashes).

The instructions below are preserved here for reference in case that comes
in handy, though the commits above also have this in their READMEs:

### Development

Run commands in the project root:

#### Linux, macOS

```bash
$ wails dev
```

#### Windows

```powershell
$env:CC="zig cc"; $env:CXX="zig c++"; wails dev
```

Or, if cross-compiling:

```powershell
&gt; $env:CC="zig cc -target x86_64-windows"; $env:CXX="zig c++ -target x86_64-windows"; wails dev
```

&lt;/details&gt; --&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Setup Development Environment&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dev Container setup is provided for easy development using GitHub Codespaces or Visual Studio Code with the DevContainers extension.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Getting started with VSCode&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make sure you have the following installed:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/"&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers"&gt;DevContainers for VSCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Open this project in VSCode&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go to the &lt;strong&gt;Remote Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; on Activity Bar&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;New Dev Container (+)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;strong&gt;Open Current Folder in Container&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This sets up a docker container with all the dependencies required for building this project. You can get started with contributing quickly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation and vision&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;(For roadmap, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/timelinize/timelinize/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22long-term%20%F0%9F%94%AD%22"&gt;issues tagged &lt;code&gt;long-term 🔭&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this project is two-fold. Both press upon me with a sense of urgency, which is why I dedicated some nights and weekends to work on this.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Connecting with my family -- both living and deceased -- is important to me and my close relatives. But I wish we had more insights into the lives of those who came before us. What was important to them? Where did they live / travel / spend their time? What lessons did they learn? How did global and local events -- or heck, even the weather -- affect them? What hardships did they endure? What would they have wanted to remember? What would it be like to talk to them? A lot of this could not be known unless they wrote it all down. But these days, we have that data for ourselves. What better time than right now to start collecting personal histories from all available sources and develop a rich timeline of our life for our family, or even just for our own reference and nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our lives are better-documented than any before us, but the record of our life is more ephemeral than any before us, too. We lose control of our data by relying on centralized, proprietary apps and cloud services which are useful today, and gone tomorrow. I wrote Timelinize because now is the time to liberate my data from corporations who don't own it, yet who have the only copy of it. This reality has made me feel uneasy for years, and it's not going away soon. Timelinize makes it bearable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to pull up a single screen with your data from any and all of your online accounts and services -- while offline. And there you see so many aspects of your life at a glance: your photos and videos, social media posts, locations on a map and how you got there, emails and letters, documents, health and physical activities, mental and emotional wellness, and maybe even music you listened to, for any given day. You can "zoom out" and get the big picture. Machine learning algorithms could suggest major clusters based on your content to summarize your days, months, or years, and from that, even recommend printing physical memorabilia. It's like a highly-detailed, automated journal, fully in your control, which you can add to in the app: augment it with your own thoughts like a regular journal.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then cross-reference your own timeline with a global public timeline: see how locations you went to changed over time, or what major news events may have affected you, or what the political/social climate -- or the literal climate -- was like at the time. For example, you may wonder, "Why did the family stay inside so much of the summer one year?" You could then see, "Oh, because it was 110 F (43 C) degrees for two months straight."&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Or translate the projection sideways, and instead of looking at time cross-sections, look at cross-sections of your timeline by media type: photos, posts, location, sentiment. Look at plots, charts, graphs, of your physical activity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Or view projections by space instead of time: view interrelations between items on a map, even items that don't have location data, because the database is entity-aware. So if a person receives a text message and the same person has location information at about the same time from a photo or GPS device, then the text message can appear on a map too, reminding you where you first got the text with the news about your nephew's birth.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And all of this runs on your own computer: no one else has access to it, no one else owns it, but you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And if everyone had their own timeline, in theory they could be merged into a global supertimeline to become a thorough record of the human race, all without the need for centralizing our data on cloud services that are controlled by greedy corporations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I've been working on this project since about 2013, even before I conceptualized &lt;a href="https://caddyserver.com"&gt;Caddy&lt;/a&gt;. My initial vision was to create an automated backup of my Picasa albums that I could store on my own hard drive. This project was called Photobak. Picasa eventually became Google Photos, and about the same time I realized I wanted to backup my photos posted to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, too. And while I was at it, why not include my Google Location History to augment the location data from the photos. The vision continued to expand as I realized that my family could use this too, so the schema was upgraded to support multiple people/entities as well. This could allow us to merge databases, or timelines, as family members pass, or as they share parts of their timeline around with each other. Timelinize is the mature evolution of the original project that is now designed to be a comprehensive, highly detailed archive of one's life through digital (or &lt;em&gt;digitized&lt;/em&gt;) content. An authoritative, unified record that is easy to preserve and organize.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This project is licensed with AGPL. I chose this license because I do not want others to make proprietary or commercial software using this package. The point of this project is liberation of and control over one's own, personal data, and I want to ensure that this project won't be used in anything that would perpetuate the walled garden dilemma we already face today. Even if the future of this project ever has proprietary source code, I can ensure it will stay aligned with my values and the project's original goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://golang.org"&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: any one of the &lt;strong&gt;two latest major&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html"&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Simply add the following import to your code, and then &lt;code&gt;go [build|run|test]&lt;/code&gt; will automatically fetch the necessary dependencies:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import "google.golang.org/grpc"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are trying to access &lt;code&gt;grpc-go&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt;, see the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grpc/grpc-go/master/#FAQ"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;I/O Timeout Errors&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;golang.org&lt;/code&gt; domain may be blocked from some countries. &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt; usually produces an error like the following when this happens:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
package google.golang.org/grpc: unrecognized import path "google.golang.org/grpc" (https fetch: Get https://google.golang.org/grpc?go-get=1: dial tcp 216.239.37.1:443: i/o timeout)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To build Go code, there are several options:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Set up a VPN and access google.golang.org through that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Go module support: it is possible to use the &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt; feature of &lt;code&gt;go mod&lt;/code&gt; to create aliases for golang.org packages. In your project's directory:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;go mod edit -replace=google.golang.org/grpc=github.com/grpc/grpc-go@latest
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
go build -mod=vendor
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Again, this will need to be done for all transitive dependencies hosted on golang.org as well. For details, refer to &lt;a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/28652"&gt;golang/go issue #28652&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Compiling error, undefined: grpc.SupportPackageIsVersion&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Please update to the latest version of gRPC-Go using &lt;code&gt;go get google.golang.org/grpc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;How to turn on logging&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The default logger is controlled by environment variables. Turn everything on like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_VERBOSITY_LEVEL=99
$ export GRPC_GO_LOG_SEVERITY_LEVEL=info
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;The RPC failed with error &lt;code&gt;"code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This error means the connection the RPC is using was closed, and there are many possible reasons, including:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;mis-configured transport credentials, connection failed on handshaking&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;bytes disrupted, possibly by a proxy in between&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;server shutdown&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Keepalive parameters caused connection shutdown, for example if you have configured your server to terminate connections regularly to &lt;a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/3170#issuecomment-552517779"&gt;trigger DNS lookups&lt;/a&gt;. If this is the case, you may want to increase your &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/grpc/keepalive?tab=doc#ServerParameters"&gt;MaxConnectionAgeGrace&lt;/a&gt;, to allow longer RPC calls to finish.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to debug this because the error happens on the client side but the root cause of the connection being closed is on the server side. Turn on logging on &lt;strong&gt;both client and server&lt;/strong&gt;, and see if there are any transport errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you encounter an issue, please &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype/issues"&gt;let us know using the issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Recommended&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;curl -sSfL https://get.anchore.io/grype | sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Install script options:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-b&lt;/code&gt;: Specify a custom installation directory (defaults to &lt;code&gt;./bin&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt;: More verbose logging levels (&lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; for debug, &lt;code&gt;-dd&lt;/code&gt; for trace)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt;: Verify the signature of the downloaded artifact before installation (requires &lt;a href="https://github.com/sigstore/cosign"&gt;&lt;code&gt;cosign&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to be installed)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The chocolatey distribution of grype is community-maintained and not distributed by the anchore team.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;choco install grype -y
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Homebrew&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;brew tap anchore/grype
brew install grype
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;MacPorts&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On macOS, Grype can additionally be installed from the &lt;a href="https://ports.macports.org/port/grype/"&gt;community-maintained port&lt;/a&gt; via MacPorts:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;sudo port install grype
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently, Grype is built only for macOS and Linux.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;From source&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/DEVELOPING.md#native-development"&gt;DEVELOPING.md&lt;/a&gt; for instructions to build and run from source.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're using GitHub Actions, you can use our &lt;a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/anchore-container-scan"&gt;Grype-based action&lt;/a&gt; to run vulnerability scans on your code or container images during your CI workflows.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Verifying the artifacts&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Checksums are applied to all artifacts, and the resulting checksum file is signed using cosign.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You need the following tool to verify signature:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/"&gt;Cosign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Verification steps are as follow:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Download the files you want, and the checksums.txt, checksums.txt.pem and checksums.txt.sig files from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype/releases"&gt;releases&lt;/a&gt; page:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verify the signature:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;cosign verify-blob &amp;lt;path to checksum.txt&amp;gt; \
--certificate &amp;lt;path to checksums.txt.pem&amp;gt; \
--signature &amp;lt;path to checksums.txt.sig&amp;gt; \
--certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github\.com/anchore/grype/\.github/workflows/.+' \
--certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;ol start="3"&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Once the signature is confirmed as valid, you can proceed to validate that the SHA256 sums align with the downloaded artifact:&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/#installation"&gt;Install the binary&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure that &lt;code&gt;grype&lt;/code&gt; is available in your path. To scan for vulnerabilities in an image:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype &amp;lt;image&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The above command scans for vulnerabilities visible in the container (i.e., the squashed representation of the image). To include software from all image layers in the vulnerability scan, regardless of its presence in the final image, provide &lt;code&gt;--scope all-layers&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype &amp;lt;image&amp;gt; --scope all-layers
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To run grype from a Docker container so it can scan a running container, use the following command:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yml"&gt;docker run --rm \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
--name Grype anchore/grype:latest \
$(ImageName):$(ImageTag)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Supported sources&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype can scan a variety of sources beyond those found in Docker.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# scan a container image archive (from the result of `docker image save ...`, `podman save ...`, or `skopeo copy` commands)
grype path/to/image.tar

# scan a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container
grype path/to/image.sif

# scan a directory
grype dir:path/to/dir
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sources can be explicitly provided with a scheme:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;podman:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Podman daemon
docker:yourrepo/yourimage:tag          use images from the Docker daemon
docker-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar   use a tarball from disk for archives created from "docker save"
oci-archive:path/to/yourimage.tar      use a tarball from disk for OCI archives (from Skopeo or otherwise)
oci-dir:path/to/yourimage              read directly from a path on disk for OCI layout directories (from Skopeo or otherwise)
singularity:path/to/yourimage.sif      read directly from a Singularity Image Format (SIF) container on disk
dir:path/to/yourproject                read directly from a path on disk (any directory)
file:path/to/yourfile                  read directly from a file on disk
sbom:path/to/syft.json                 read Syft JSON from path on disk
registry:yourrepo/yourimage:tag        pull image directly from a registry (no container runtime required)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If an image source is not provided and cannot be detected from the given reference it is assumed the image should be pulled from the Docker daemon. If docker is not present, then the Podman daemon is attempted next, followed by reaching out directly to the image registry last.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This default behavior can be overridden with the &lt;code&gt;default-image-pull-source&lt;/code&gt; configuration option (See &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype#configuration"&gt;Configuration&lt;/a&gt; for more details).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Use SBOMs for even faster vulnerability scanning in Grype:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Then scan for new vulnerabilities as frequently as needed
grype sbom:./sbom.json

# (You can also pipe the SBOM into Grype)
cat ./sbom.json | grype
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype supports input of &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft"&gt;Syft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/"&gt;SPDX&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/"&gt;CycloneDX&lt;/a&gt; SBOM formats. If Syft has generated any of these file types, they should have the appropriate information to work properly with Grype. It is also possible to use SBOMs generated by other tools with varying degrees of success. Two things that make Grype matching more successful are the inclusion of CPE and Linux distribution information. If an SBOM does not include any CPE information, it is possible to generate these based on package information using the &lt;code&gt;--add-cpes-if-none&lt;/code&gt; flag. To specify a distribution, use the &lt;code&gt;--distro &amp;lt;distro&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; flag. A full example is:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype --add-cpes-if-none --distro alpine:3.10 sbom:some-alpine-3.10.spdx.json
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Threat &amp;amp; Risk Prioritization&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This section explains the columns and UI cues that help prioritize remediation efforts:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt;: String-based severity derived from CVSS scores that indicates the significance of a vulnerability in levels. This balances concerns such as ease of exploitability, and the potential to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of software and services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPSS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.first.org/epss/model"&gt;Exploit Prediction Scoring System&lt;/a&gt; is a metric expressing the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild over the next 30 days (on a 0–1 scale); higher values signal a greater likelihood of exploitation. The table output shows the EPSS percentile, a one-way transform of the EPSS score showing the proportion of all scored vulnerabilities with an equal or lower probability. Percentiles linearize a heavily skewed distribution, making threshold choice (e.g. “only CVEs above the 90th percentile”) straightforward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEV Indicator&lt;/strong&gt;: Flags entries from CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog"&gt;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog&lt;/a&gt; --an authoritative list of flaws observed being exploited in the wild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Score&lt;/strong&gt;: A composite 0–100 metric calculated as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-markdown"&gt;risk = min(1, threat * average(severity)) * 100
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;severity&lt;/code&gt; is the average of all CVSS scores and string severity for a vulnerability (scaled between 0–1).&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;threat&lt;/code&gt; is the EPSS score (between 0–1). If the vulnerability is on the KEV list then &lt;code&gt;threat&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1.05&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;1.1&lt;/code&gt; if the vulnerability is associated with a ransomware campaign. This metric is one way to combine EPSS and CVSS suggested in the &lt;a href="https://www.first.org/epss/user-guide"&gt;EPSS user guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggested Fixes&lt;/strong&gt;: All possible fixes for a package are listed, however, when multiple fixes are available, we de-emphasize all upgrade paths except for the minimal upgrade path (which highlights the smallest, safest version bump).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Results default to sorting by Risk Score and can be overridden with &lt;code&gt;--sort-by &amp;lt;value&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;severity&lt;/code&gt;: sort by severity&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;epss&lt;/code&gt;: sort by EPSS percentile (aka, "threat")&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;risk&lt;/code&gt;: sort by risk score&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;kev&lt;/code&gt;: just like risk, except that KEV entries are always above non-KEV entries&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;package&lt;/code&gt;: sort by package name, version, type&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;vulnerability&lt;/code&gt;: sort by vulnerability ID&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Supported versions&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Software updates are always applied to the latest version of Grype; fixes are not backported to any previous versions of Grype.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In terms of database updates, any version of Grype before v0.51.0 (Oct 2022, before schema v5) will not receive vulnerability database updates. You can still build vulnerability databases for unsupported Grype releases by using previous releases of &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/vunnel"&gt;vunnel&lt;/a&gt; to gather the upstream data and &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype-db"&gt;grype-db&lt;/a&gt; to build databases for unsupported schemas.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Only the latest database schema is considered to be supported. When a new database schema is introduced then the one it replaces is marked as deprecated. Deprecated schemas will continue to receive updates for at least one year after they are marked as deprecated at which point they will no longer be supported.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Working with attestations&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype supports scanning SBOMs as input via stdin. Users can use &lt;a href="https://github.com/sigstore/cosign"&gt;cosign&lt;/a&gt; to verify attestations with an SBOM as its content to scan an image for vulnerabilities:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;COSIGN_EXPERIMENTAL=1 cosign verify-attestation caphill4/java-spdx-tools:latest \
| jq -r .payload \
| base64 --decode \
| jq -r .predicate.Data \
| grype
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Vulnerability Summary&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Basic Grype Vulnerability Data Shape&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-json"&gt; {
  "vulnerability": {
    ...
  },
  "relatedVulnerabilities": [
    ...
  ],
  "matchDetails": [
    ...
  ],
  "artifact": {
    ...
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;: All information on the specific vulnerability that was directly matched on (e.g. ID, severity, CVSS score, fix information, links for more information)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RelatedVulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: Information pertaining to vulnerabilities found to be related to the main reported vulnerability. Perhaps the vulnerability we matched on was a GitHub Security Advisory, which has an upstream CVE (in the authoritative national vulnerability database). In these cases we list the upstream vulnerabilities here.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MatchDetails&lt;/strong&gt;: This section tries to explain what we searched for while looking for a match and exactly what details on the package and vulnerability that led to a match.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artifact&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a subset of the information that we know about the package (when compared to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft"&gt;Syft&lt;/a&gt; json output, we summarize the metadata section). This has information about where within the container image or directory we found the package, what kind of package it is, licensing info, pURLs, CPEs, etc.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Excluding file paths&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype can exclude files and paths from being scanned within a source by using glob expressions with one or more &lt;code&gt;--exclude&lt;/code&gt; parameters:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype &amp;lt;source&amp;gt; --exclude './out/**/*.json' --exclude /etc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; in the case of &lt;em&gt;image scanning&lt;/em&gt;, since the entire filesystem is scanned it is possible to use absolute paths like &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/usr/**/*.txt&lt;/code&gt; whereas &lt;em&gt;directory scans&lt;/em&gt; exclude files &lt;em&gt;relative to the specified directory&lt;/em&gt;. For example: scanning &lt;code&gt;/usr/foo&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;--exclude ./package.json&lt;/code&gt; would exclude &lt;code&gt;/usr/foo/package.json&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--exclude '**/package.json'&lt;/code&gt; would exclude all &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; files under &lt;code&gt;/usr/foo&lt;/code&gt;. For &lt;em&gt;directory scans&lt;/em&gt;, it is required to begin path expressions with &lt;code&gt;./&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;**/&lt;/code&gt;, all of which will be resolved &lt;em&gt;relative to the specified scan directory&lt;/em&gt;. Keep in mind, your shell may attempt to expand wildcards, so put those parameters in single quotes, like: &lt;code&gt;'**/*.json'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;External Sources&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype can be configured to incorporate external data sources for added fidelity in vulnerability matching. This feature is currently disabled by default. To enable this feature add the following to the grype config:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;external-sources:
  enable: true
  maven:
    search-upstream-by-sha1: true
    base-url: https://search.maven.org/solrsearch/select
    rate-limit: 300ms # Time between Maven API requests
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can also configure the base-url if you're using another registry as your maven endpoint.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The rate at which Maven API requests are made can be configured to match your environment's requirements. The default is 300ms between requests.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Output formats&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The output format for Grype is configurable as well:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype &amp;lt;image&amp;gt; -o &amp;lt;format&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Where the formats available are:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;table&lt;/code&gt;: A columnar summary (default).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cyclonedx&lt;/code&gt;: An XML report conforming to the &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/"&gt;CycloneDX 1.6 specification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cyclonedx-json&lt;/code&gt;: A JSON report conforming to the &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/"&gt;CycloneDX 1.6 specification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt;: Use this to get as much information out of Grype as possible!&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sarif&lt;/code&gt;: Use this option to get a &lt;a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html"&gt;SARIF&lt;/a&gt; report (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt;: Lets the user specify the output format. See &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/#using-templates"&gt;"Using templates"&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Using templates&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype lets you define custom output formats, using &lt;a href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/"&gt;Go templates&lt;/a&gt;. Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Define your format as a Go template, and save this template as a file.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Set the output format to "template" (&lt;code&gt;-o template&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specify the path to the template file (&lt;code&gt;-t ./path/to/custom.template&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grype's template processing uses the same data models as the &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; output format — so if you're wondering what data is available as you author a template, you can use the output from &lt;code&gt;grype &amp;lt;image&amp;gt; -o json&lt;/code&gt; as a reference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; Templates can access information about the system they are running on, such as environment variables. You should never run untrusted templates.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are several example templates in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype/tree/main/templates"&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; directory in the Grype source which can serve as a starting point for a custom output format. For example, &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype/raw/main/templates/csv.tmpl"&gt;csv.tmpl&lt;/a&gt; produces a vulnerability report in CSV (comma separated value) format:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-text"&gt;"Package","Version Installed","Vulnerability ID","Severity"
"coreutils","8.30-3ubuntu2","CVE-2016-2781","Low"
"libc-bin","2.31-0ubuntu9","CVE-2016-10228","Negligible"
"libc-bin","2.31-0ubuntu9","CVE-2020-6096","Low"
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can also find the template for the default "table" output format in the same place.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype also includes a vast array of utility templating functions from &lt;a href="http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/"&gt;sprig&lt;/a&gt; apart from the default golang &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#hdr-Functions"&gt;text/template&lt;/a&gt; to allow users to customize the output from Grype.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Gating on severity of vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can have Grype exit with an error if any vulnerabilities are reported at or above the specified severity level. This comes in handy when using Grype within a script or CI pipeline. To do this, use the &lt;code&gt;--fail-on &amp;lt;severity&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; CLI flag.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, here's how you could trigger a CI pipeline failure if any vulnerabilities are found in the &lt;code&gt;ubuntu:latest&lt;/code&gt; image with a severity of "medium" or higher:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype ubuntu:latest --fail-on medium
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Grype returns exit code &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; on vulnerability errors.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Specifying matches to ignore&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're seeing Grype report &lt;strong&gt;false positives&lt;/strong&gt; or any other vulnerability matches that you just don't want to see, you can tell Grype to &lt;strong&gt;ignore&lt;/strong&gt; matches by specifying one or more &lt;em&gt;"ignore rules"&lt;/em&gt; in your Grype configuration file (e.g. &lt;code&gt;~/.grype.yaml&lt;/code&gt;). This causes Grype not to report any vulnerability matches that meet the criteria specified by any of your ignore rules.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each rule can specify any combination of the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;vulnerability ID (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"CVE-2008-4318"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;include vulnerability aliases when matching on a vulnerability ID (set &lt;code&gt;"include-aliases"&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;namespace (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"nvd"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;fix state (allowed values: &lt;code&gt;"fixed"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"not-fixed"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"wont-fix"&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;"unknown"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;match type (allowed values: &lt;code&gt;"exact-direct-match"&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;"exact-indirect-match"&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;"cpe-match"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;package name (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"libcurl"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;package version (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"1.5.1"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;package language (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"python"&lt;/code&gt;; these values are defined &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft/raw/main/syft/pkg/language.go#L14-L23"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;package type (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"npm"&lt;/code&gt;; these values are defined &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft/raw/main/syft/pkg/type.go#L10-L24"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;package location (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/**"&lt;/code&gt;; supports glob patterns)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;package upstream name (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"curl"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can also document a rule with a free-form &lt;code&gt;reason&lt;/code&gt;, and use VEX-specific fields (&lt;code&gt;vex-status&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vex-justification&lt;/code&gt;) when providing VEX data.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example &lt;code&gt;~/.grype.yaml&lt;/code&gt; that demonstrates the expected format for ignore rules:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;ignore:
  # This is the full set of supported rule fields:
  - vulnerability: CVE-2008-4318
    include-aliases: true
    reason: "False positive due to bundled curl version"
    fix-state: unknown
    namespace: nvd
    # VEX fields apply when Grype reads vex data:
    vex-status: not_affected
    vex-justification: vulnerable_code_not_present
    match-type: exact-direct-match
    package:
      name: libcurl
      version: 1.5.1
      language: python
      type: npm
      location: "/usr/local/lib/node_modules/**"
      upstream-name: curl

  # We can make rules to match just by vulnerability ID:
  - vulnerability: CVE-2014-54321

  # ...or just by a single package field:
  - package:
      type: gem
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability matches will be ignored if &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; rules apply to the match. A rule is considered to apply to a given vulnerability match only if &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; fields specified in the rule apply to the vulnerability match.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you run Grype while specifying ignore rules, the following happens to the vulnerability matches that are "ignored":&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ignored matches are &lt;strong&gt;completely hidden&lt;/strong&gt; from Grype's output, except for when using the &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;template&lt;/code&gt; output formats; however, in these two formats, the ignored matches are &lt;strong&gt;removed&lt;/strong&gt; from the existing &lt;code&gt;matches&lt;/code&gt; array field, and they are placed in a new &lt;code&gt;ignoredMatches&lt;/code&gt; array field. Each listed ignored match also has an additional field, &lt;code&gt;appliedIgnoreRules&lt;/code&gt;, which is an array of any rules that caused Grype to ignore this vulnerability match.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ignored matches &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; factor into Grype's exit status decision when using &lt;code&gt;--fail-on &amp;lt;severity&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For instance, if a user specifies &lt;code&gt;--fail-on critical&lt;/code&gt;, and all of the vulnerability matches found with a "critical" severity have been &lt;em&gt;ignored&lt;/em&gt;, Grype will exit zero.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Please continue to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype/issues/new/choose"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; any false positives you see! Even if you can reliably filter out false positives using ignore rules, it's very helpful to the Grype community if we have as much knowledge about Grype's false positives as possible. This helps us continuously improve Grype!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Showing only "fixed" vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you only want Grype to report vulnerabilities &lt;strong&gt;that have a confirmed fix&lt;/strong&gt;, you can use the &lt;code&gt;--only-fixed&lt;/code&gt; flag. (This automatically adds &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/#specifying-matches-to-ignore"&gt;ignore rules&lt;/a&gt; into Grype's configuration, such that vulnerabilities that aren't fixed will be ignored.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For example, here's a scan of Alpine 3.10:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NAME          INSTALLED  FIXED-IN   VULNERABILITY   SEVERITY
apk-tools     2.10.6-r0  2.10.7-r0  CVE-2021-36159  Critical
libcrypto1.1  1.1.1k-r0             CVE-2021-3711   Critical
libcrypto1.1  1.1.1k-r0             CVE-2021-3712   High
libssl1.1     1.1.1k-r0             CVE-2021-3712   High
libssl1.1     1.1.1k-r0             CVE-2021-3711   Critical
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;...and here's the same scan, but adding the flag &lt;code&gt;--only-fixed&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NAME       INSTALLED  FIXED-IN   VULNERABILITY   SEVERITY
apk-tools  2.10.6-r0  2.10.7-r0  CVE-2021-36159  Critical
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want Grype to only report vulnerabilities &lt;strong&gt;that do not have a confirmed fix&lt;/strong&gt;, you can use the &lt;code&gt;--only-notfixed&lt;/code&gt; flag. Alternatively, you can use the &lt;code&gt;--ignore-states&lt;/code&gt; flag to filter results for vulnerabilities with specific states such as &lt;code&gt;wont-fix&lt;/code&gt; (see &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; for a list of valid fix states). These flags automatically add &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/#specifying-matches-to-ignore"&gt;ignore rules&lt;/a&gt; into Grype's configuration, such that vulnerabilities which are fixed, or will not be fixed, will be ignored.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;VEX Support&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype can use VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange) data to filter false positives or provide additional context, augmenting matches. When scanning a container image, you can use the &lt;code&gt;--vex&lt;/code&gt; flag to point to one or more &lt;a href="https://github.com/openvex"&gt;OpenVEX&lt;/a&gt; documents.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;VEX statements relate a product (a container image), a vulnerability, and a VEX status to express an assertion of the vulnerability's impact. There are four &lt;a href="https://github.com/openvex/spec/raw/main/OPENVEX-SPEC.md#status-labels"&gt;VEX statuses&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;not_affected&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;affected&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;under_investigation&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a simple OpenVEX document. (tip: use &lt;a href="https://github.com/openvex/vexctl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;vexctl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to generate your own documents).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-json"&gt;{
  "@context": "https://openvex.dev/ns/v0.2.0",
  "@id": "https://openvex.dev/docs/public/vex-d4e9020b6d0d26f131d535e055902dd6ccf3e2088bce3079a8cd3588a4b14c78",
  "author": "A Grype User &amp;lt;jdoe@example.com&amp;gt;",
  "timestamp": "2023-07-17T18:28:47.696004345-06:00",
  "version": 1,
  "statements": [
    {
      "vulnerability": {
        "name": "CVE-2023-1255"
      },
      "products": [
        {
          "@id": "pkg:oci/alpine@sha256%3A124c7d2707904eea7431fffe91522a01e5a861a624ee31d03372cc1d138a3126",
          "subcomponents": [
            { "@id": "pkg:apk/alpine/libssl3@3.0.8-r3" },
            { "@id": "pkg:apk/alpine/libcrypto3@3.0.8-r3" }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "status": "fixed"
    }
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By default, Grype will use any statements in specified VEX documents with a status of &lt;code&gt;not_affected&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fixed&lt;/code&gt; to move matches to the ignore set.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Any matches ignored as a result of VEX statements are flagged when using &lt;code&gt;--show-suppressed&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;libcrypto3  3.0.8-r3   3.0.8-r4   apk   CVE-2023-1255  Medium (suppressed by VEX)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Statements with an &lt;code&gt;affected&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;under_investigation&lt;/code&gt; status will only be considered to augment the result set when specifically requested using the &lt;code&gt;GRYPE_VEX_ADD&lt;/code&gt; environment variable or in a configuration file.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;VEX Ignore Rules&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ignore rules can be written to control how Grype honors VEX statements. For example, to configure Grype to only act on VEX statements when the justification is &lt;code&gt;vulnerable_code_not_present&lt;/code&gt;, you can write a rule like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;---
ignore:
  - vex-status: not_affected
    vex-justification: vulnerable_code_not_present
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://github.com/openvex/spec/raw/main/OPENVEX-SPEC.md#status-justifications"&gt;list of justifications&lt;/a&gt; for details. You can mix &lt;code&gt;vex-status&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vex-justification&lt;/code&gt; with other ignore rule parameters.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Grype's database&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When Grype performs a scan for vulnerabilities, it does so using a vulnerability database that's stored on your local filesystem, which is constructed by pulling data from a variety of publicly available vulnerability data sources. These sources include:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Alpine Linux SecDB: &lt;a href="https://secdb.alpinelinux.org/"&gt;https://secdb.alpinelinux.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Amazon Linux ALAS: &lt;a href="https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/alas.rss"&gt;https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/alas.rss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;Debian Linux CVE Tracker: &lt;a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/json"&gt;https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;GitHub Security Advisories (GHSAs): &lt;a href="https://github.com/advisories"&gt;https://github.com/advisories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;MinimOS SecDB: &lt;a href="https://packages.mini.dev/advisories/secdb/security.json"&gt;https://packages.mini.dev/advisories/secdb/security.json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;National Vulnerability Database (NVD): &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds"&gt;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Oracle Linux OVAL: &lt;a href="https://linux.oracle.com/security/oval/"&gt;https://linux.oracle.com/security/oval/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;RedHat Linux Security Data: &lt;a href="https://access.redhat.com/hydra/rest/securitydata/"&gt;https://access.redhat.com/hydra/rest/securitydata/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;RedHat RHSAs: &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/"&gt;https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;SUSE Linux OVAL: &lt;a href="https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/"&gt;https://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/security/oval/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Ubuntu Linux Security: &lt;a href="https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/"&gt;https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Wolfi SecDB: &lt;a href="https://packages.wolfi.dev/os/security.json"&gt;https://packages.wolfi.dev/os/security.json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By default, Grype automatically manages this database for you. Grype checks for new updates to the vulnerability database to make sure that every scan uses up-to-date vulnerability information. This behavior is configurable. For more information, see the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/#managing-grypes-database"&gt;Managing Grype's database&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;How database updates work&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype's vulnerability database is a SQLite file, named &lt;code&gt;vulnerability.db&lt;/code&gt;. Updates to the database are atomic: the entire database is replaced and then treated as "readonly" by Grype.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype's first step in a database update is discovering databases that are available for retrieval. Grype does this by requesting a "latest database file" from a public endpoint:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://grype.anchore.io/databases/v6/latest.json"&gt;https://grype.anchore.io/databases/v6/latest.json&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The latest database file contains an entry for the most recent database available for download.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of an entry in the latest database file:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-json"&gt;{
  "status": "active",
  "schemaVersion": "6.0.0",
  "built": "2025-02-11T04:06:41Z",
  "path": "vulnerability-db_v6.0.0_2025-02-11T01:30:51Z_1739246801.tar.zst",
  "checksum": "sha256:79bfa04265c5a32d21773ad0da1bda13c31e932fa1e1422db635c8d714038868"
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With this information, Grype can find the most recently built database with the current schema version, download the database, and verify the database's integrity using the &lt;code&gt;checksum&lt;/code&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Managing Grype's database&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; During normal usage, &lt;em&gt;there is no need for users to manage Grype's database!&lt;/em&gt; Grype manages its database behind the scenes. However, for users that need more control, Grype provides options to manage the database more explicitly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Local database cache directory&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By default, the database is cached on the local filesystem in the directory &lt;code&gt;$XDG_CACHE_HOME/grype/db/&amp;lt;SCHEMA-VERSION&amp;gt;/&lt;/code&gt;. For example, on macOS, the database would be stored in &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Caches/grype/db/6/&lt;/code&gt;. (For more information on XDG paths, refer to the &lt;a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html"&gt;XDG Base Directory Specification&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can set the cache directory path using the environment variable &lt;code&gt;GRYPE_DB_CACHE_DIR&lt;/code&gt;. If setting that variable alone does not work, then the &lt;code&gt;TMPDIR&lt;/code&gt; environment variable might also need to be set.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Data staleness&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype needs up-to-date vulnerability information to provide accurate matches. By default, it will fail execution if the local database was not built in the last 5 days. The data staleness check is configurable via the environment variable &lt;code&gt;GRYPE_DB_MAX_ALLOWED_BUILT_AGE&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GRYPE_DB_VALIDATE_AGE&lt;/code&gt; or the field &lt;code&gt;max-allowed-built-age&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;validate-age&lt;/code&gt;, under &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt;. It uses &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration"&gt;golang's time duration syntax&lt;/a&gt;. Set &lt;code&gt;GRYPE_DB_VALIDATE_AGE&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;validate-age&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; to disable staleness check.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Offline and air-gapped environments&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By default, Grype checks for a new database on every run, by making a network request over the internet. You can tell Grype not to perform this check by setting the environment variable &lt;code&gt;GRYPE_DB_AUTO_UPDATE&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As long as you place Grype's &lt;code&gt;vulnerability.db&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;import.json&lt;/code&gt; files in the cache directory for the expected schema version, Grype has no need to access the network. Additionally, you can get a reference to the latest database archive for download from the &lt;code&gt;grype db list&lt;/code&gt; command in an online environment, download the database archive, transfer it to your offline environment, and use &lt;code&gt;grype db import &amp;lt;db-archive-path&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to use the given database in an offline capacity.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to distribute your own Grype databases internally without needing to use &lt;code&gt;db import&lt;/code&gt; manually you can leverage Grype's DB update mechanism. To do this you can craft your own &lt;code&gt;latest.json&lt;/code&gt; file similar to the public "latest database file" and change the download URL to point to an internal endpoint (e.g. a private S3 bucket, an internal file server, etc.). Any internal installation of Grype can receive database updates automatically by configuring the &lt;code&gt;db.update-url&lt;/code&gt; (same as the &lt;code&gt;GRYPE_DB_UPDATE_URL&lt;/code&gt; environment variable) to point to the hosted &lt;code&gt;latest.json&lt;/code&gt; file you've crafted.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;CLI commands for database management&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype provides database-specific CLI commands for users that want to control the database from the command line. Here are some of the useful commands provided:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype db status&lt;/code&gt; — report the current status of Grype's database (such as its location, build date, and checksum)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype db check&lt;/code&gt; — see if updates are available for the database&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype db update&lt;/code&gt; — ensure the latest database has been downloaded to the cache directory (Grype performs this operation at the beginning of every scan by default)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype db list&lt;/code&gt; — download the latest database file configured at &lt;code&gt;db.update-url&lt;/code&gt; and show the database available for download&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype db import&lt;/code&gt; — provide grype with a database archive to explicitly use (useful for offline DB updates)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype db providers&lt;/code&gt; - provides a detailed list of database providers&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Find complete information on Grype's database commands by running &lt;code&gt;grype db --help&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Shell completion&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Grype supplies shell completion through its CLI implementation (&lt;a href="https://github.com/spf13/cobra/raw/master/shell_completions.md"&gt;cobra&lt;/a&gt;). Generate the completion code for your shell by running one of the following commands:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;grype completion &amp;lt;bash|zsh|fish&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;go run ./cmd/grype completion &amp;lt;bash|zsh|fish&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This will output a shell script to STDOUT, which can then be used as a completion script for Grype. Running one of the above commands with the &lt;code&gt;-h&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; flags will provide instructions on how to do that for your chosen shell.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Private Registry Authentication&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Local Docker Credentials&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When a container runtime is not present, grype can still utilize credentials configured in common credential sources (such as &lt;code&gt;~/.docker/config.json&lt;/code&gt;). It will pull images from private registries using these credentials. The config file is where your credentials are stored when authenticating with private registries via some command like &lt;code&gt;docker login&lt;/code&gt;. For more information see the &lt;code&gt;go-containerregistry&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/pkg/authn"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;An example &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// config.json
{
  "auths": {
    "registry.example.com": {
      "username": "AzureDiamond",
      "password": "hunter2"
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can run the following command as an example. It details the mount/environment configuration a container needs to access a private registry:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -v ./config.json:/config/config.json -e "DOCKER_CONFIG=/config" anchore/grype:latest &amp;lt;private_image&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Docker Credentials in Kubernetes&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The below section shows a simple workflow on how to mount this config file as a secret into a container on kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create a secret. The value of &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; is important. It refers to the specification detailed &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/pkg/authn#the-config-file"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Below this section is the &lt;code&gt;secret.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file that the pod configuration will consume as a volume. The key &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; is important. It will end up being the name of the file when mounted into the pod. &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-#"&gt;
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: registry-config
      namespace: grype
    data:
      config.json: &amp;lt;base64 encoded config.json&amp;gt;
    ```

    `kubectl apply -f secret.yaml`

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create your pod running grype. The env &lt;code&gt;DOCKER_CONFIG&lt;/code&gt; is important because it advertises where to look for the credential file. In the below example, setting &lt;code&gt;DOCKER_CONFIG=/config&lt;/code&gt; informs grype that credentials can be found at &lt;code&gt;/config/config.json&lt;/code&gt;. This is why we used &lt;code&gt;config.json&lt;/code&gt; as the key for our secret. When mounted into containers the secrets' key is used as the filename. The &lt;code&gt;volumeMounts&lt;/code&gt; section mounts our secret to &lt;code&gt;/config&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;volumes&lt;/code&gt; section names our volume and leverages the secret we created in step one. &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-#"&gt;
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: anchore/grype:latest
          name: grype-private-registry-demo
          env:
            - name: DOCKER_CONFIG
              value: /config
          volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /config
            name: registry-config
            readOnly: true
          args:
            - &amp;lt;private_image&amp;gt;
      volumes:
      - name: registry-config
        secret:
          secretName: registry-config
    ```

    `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The user can now run &lt;code&gt;kubectl logs grype-private-registry-demo&lt;/code&gt;. The logs should show the grype analysis for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;private_image&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; provided in the pod configuration.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Using the above information, users should be able to configure private registry access without having to do so in the &lt;code&gt;grype&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;syft&lt;/code&gt; configuration files. They will also not be dependent on a docker daemon, (or some other runtime software) for registry configuration and access.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Default configuration search paths (see all with &lt;code&gt;grype config locations&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.grype.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;.grype/config.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;~/.grype.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;XDG_CONFIG_HOME&amp;gt;/grype/config.yaml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;grype config&lt;/code&gt; to print a sample config file to stdout. Use &lt;code&gt;grype config --load&lt;/code&gt; to print the current config after loading all values to stdout.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can specify files directly using the &lt;code&gt;--config&lt;/code&gt; / &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; flags (or environment variable &lt;code&gt;GRYPE_CONFIG&lt;/code&gt;) to provide your own configuration files/paths:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;# Using the flag
grype &amp;lt;image&amp;gt; -c /path/to/config.yaml
# Or using the environment variable
GRYPE_CONFIG=/path/to/config.yaml grype &amp;lt;image&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Configuration options (example values are the default):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is Rook?&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Rook is an open source &lt;strong&gt;cloud-native storage orchestrator&lt;/strong&gt; for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for Ceph storage to natively integrate with Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ceph.com/"&gt;Ceph&lt;/a&gt; is a distributed storage system that provides file, block and object storage and is deployed in large scale production clusters.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Rook automates deployment and management of Ceph to provide self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. The Rook operator does this by building on Kubernetes resources to deploy, configure, provision, scale, upgrade, and monitor Ceph.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The status of the Ceph storage provider is &lt;strong&gt;Stable&lt;/strong&gt;. Features and improvements will be planned for many future versions. Upgrades between versions are provided to ensure backward compatibility between releases.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Rook is hosted by the &lt;a href="https://cncf.io"&gt;Cloud Native Computing Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (CNCF) as a &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/10/07/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-rook-graduation/"&gt;graduated&lt;/a&gt; level project. If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who's involved and how Rook plays a role, read the CNCF &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/01/29/cncf-host-rook-project-cloud-native-storage-capabilities"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;🤷‍ What is go-zero?&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;English | &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeromicro/go-zero/master/readme-cn.md"&gt;简体中文&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;go-zero (listed in CNCF Landscape: &lt;a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=go-zero"&gt;https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=go-zero&lt;/a&gt;) is a web and rpc framework with lots of builtin engineering practices. It’s born to ensure the stability of the busy services with resilience design and has been serving sites with tens of millions of users for years.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;go-zero contains simple API description syntax and code generation tool called &lt;code&gt;goctl&lt;/code&gt;. You can generate Go, iOS, Android, Kotlin, Dart, TypeScript, JavaScript from .api files with &lt;code&gt;goctl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Advantages of go-zero:&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Improves the stability of the services with tens of millions of daily active users&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Builtin chained timeout control, concurrency control, rate limit, adaptive circuit breaker, adaptive load shedding, even no configuration needed&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Builtin middlewares also can be integrated into your frameworks&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Simple API syntax, one command to generate a couple of different languages&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Auto validate the request parameters from clients&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Plenty of builtin microservice management and concurrent toolkits&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/main/doc/images/architecture-en.png" alt="Architecture" width="1500" /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Backgrounds of go-zero&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In early 2018, we embarked on a transformative journey to redesign our system, transitioning from a monolithic architecture built with Java and MongoDB to a microservices architecture. After careful research and comparison, we made a deliberate choice to:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go Beyond with Golang&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Great performance&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Simple syntax&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Proven engineering efficiency&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Extreme deployment experience&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Less server resource consumption&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Self-Design Our Microservice Architecture&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Microservice architecture facilitates the creation of scalable, flexible, and maintainable software systems with independent, reusable components.&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Easy to locate the problems within microservices.&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Easy to extend the features by adding or modifying specific microservices without impacting the entire system.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Design considerations on go-zero&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By designing the microservice architecture, we expected to ensure stability, as well as productivity. And from just the beginning, we have the following design principles:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Keep it simple&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;High availability&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Stable on high concurrency&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Easy to extend&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Resilience design, failure-oriented programming&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Try best to be friendly to the business logic development, encapsulate the complexity&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;One thing, one way&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After almost half a year, we finished the transfer from a monolithic system to microservice system and deployed on August 2018. The new system guaranteed business growth and system stability.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The implementation and features of go-zero&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;go-zero is a web and rpc framework that integrates lots of engineering practices. The features are mainly listed below:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Powerful tool included, less code to write&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Simple interfaces&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Fully compatible with net/http&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Middlewares are supported, easy to extend&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;High performance&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Failure-oriented programming, resilience design&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Builtin service discovery, load balancing&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Builtin concurrency control, adaptive circuit breaker, adaptive load shedding, auto-trigger, auto recover&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Auto validation of API request parameters&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Chained timeout control&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Auto management of data caching&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Call tracing, metrics, and monitoring&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;High concurrency protected&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As below, go-zero protects the system with a couple of layers and mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/main/doc/images/resilience-en.png" alt="Resilience" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The simplified architecture that we use with go-zero&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;img width="1067" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1918356/171880372-5010d846-e8b1-4942-8fe2-e2bbb584f762.png" /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Run the following command under your project:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;go get -u github.com/zeromicro/go-zero
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Full examples can be checked out from below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/raw/main/doc/shorturl-en.md"&gt;Rapid development of microservice systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/raw/main/docs/zero/bookstore-en.md"&gt;Rapid development of microservice systems - multiple RPCs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Install goctl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;goctl&lt;/code&gt;can be read as &lt;code&gt;go control&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;goctl&lt;/code&gt; means not to be controlled by code, instead, we control it. The inside &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; is not &lt;code&gt;golang&lt;/code&gt;. At the very beginning, I was expecting it to help us improve productivity, and make our lives easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;# for Go
go install github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/tools/goctl@latest

# For Mac
brew install goctl

# docker for all platforms
docker pull kevinwan/goctl
# run goctl
docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/app kevinwan/goctl --help
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;make sure goctl is executable and in your $PATH.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create the API file, like greet.api, you can install the plugin of goctl in vs code, api syntax is supported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;type (
  Request {
    Name string `path:"name,options=[you,me]"` // parameters are auto validated
  }

  Response {
    Message string `json:"message"`
  }
)

service greet-api {
  @handler GreetHandler
  get /greet/from/:name(Request) returns (Response)
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;the .api files also can be generated by goctl, like below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;goctl api -o greet.api
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generate the go server-side code&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;goctl api go -api greet.api -dir greet
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;the generated files look like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-Plain"&gt;├── greet
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ├── etc
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── greet-api.yaml        // configuration file
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ├── greet.go                  // main file
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── internal
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     ├── config
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── config.go         // configuration definition
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     ├── handler
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ├── greethandler.go   // get/put/post/delete routes are defined here
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── routes.go         // routes list
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     ├── logic
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── greetlogic.go     // request logic can be written here
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     ├── svc
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     │&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; └── servicecontext.go // service context, mysql/redis can be passed in here
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     └── types
│&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;         └── types.go          // request/response defined here
└── greet.api                     // api description file
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;the generated code can be run directly:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;cd greet
go mod tidy
go run greet.go -f etc/greet-api.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;by default, it’s listening on port 8888, while it can be changed in the configuration file.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;you can check it by curl:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;curl -i http://localhost:8888/greet/from/you
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;the response looks like below:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-http"&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 30 Aug 2020 15:32:35 GMT
Content-Length: 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Write the business logic code&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;the dependencies can be passed into the logic within servicecontext.go, like mysql, redis, etc.&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;add the logic code in a logic package according to .api file&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generate code like Java, TypeScript, Dart, JavaScript, etc. just from the api file&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;goctl api java -api greet.api -dir greet
goctl api dart -api greet.api -dir greet
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. It provides a simple flat Layer 3 network with the ability to span multiple clusters in either a native routing or overlay mode. It is L7-protocol aware and can enforce network policies on L3-L7 using an identity based security model that is decoupled from network addressing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Cilium implements distributed load balancing for traffic between pods and to external services, and is able to fully replace kube-proxy, using efficient hash tables in eBPF allowing for almost unlimited scale. It also supports advanced functionality like integrated ingress and egress gateway, bandwidth management and service mesh, and provides deep network and security visibility and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A new Linux kernel technology called eBPF_ is at the foundation of Cilium. It supports dynamic insertion of eBPF bytecode into the Linux kernel at various integration points such as: network IO, application sockets, and tracepoints to implement security, networking and visibility logic. eBPF is highly efficient and flexible. To learn more about eBPF, visit &lt;code&gt;eBPF.io&lt;/code&gt;_.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Functionality Overview&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;.. begin-functionality-overview&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;CNI (Container Network Interface)&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Cilium as a CNI plugin &amp;lt;https://cilium.io/use-cases/cni/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_ provides a fast, scalable, and secure networking layer for Kubernetes clusters. Built on eBPF, it offers several deployment options:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overlay networking:&lt;/strong&gt; encapsulation-based virtual network spanning all hosts with support for VXLAN and Geneve. It works on almost any network infrastructure as the only requirement is IP connectivity between hosts which is typically already given.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native routing mode:&lt;/strong&gt; Use of the regular routing table of the Linux host. The network is required to be capable of routing the IP addresses of the application containers. It integrates with cloud routers, routing daemons, and IPv6-native infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible routing options:&lt;/strong&gt; Cilium can automate route learning and advertisement in common topologies such as using L2 neighbor discovery when nodes share a layer 2 domain, or BGP when routing across layer 3 boundaries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each mode is designed for maximum interoperability with existing infrastructure while minimizing operational burden.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Load Balancing&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Cilium implements distributed load balancing for traffic between application containers and to/from external services. The load balancing is implemented in eBPF using efficient hashtables enabling high service density and low latency at scale.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;East-west load balancing&lt;/strong&gt; rewrites service connections at the socket level (&lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt;), avoiding the overhead of per-packet NAT and fully &lt;code&gt;replacing kube-proxy &amp;lt;https://cilium.io/use-cases/kube-proxy/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North-south load balancing&lt;/strong&gt; supports XDP for high-throughput scenarios and &lt;code&gt;layer 4 load balancing &amp;lt;https://cilium.io/use-cases/load-balancer/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_ including Direct Server Return (DSR), and Maglev consistent hashing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Cluster Mesh&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Cilium &lt;code&gt;Cluster Mesh &amp;lt;https://cilium.io/use-cases/cluster-mesh/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_ enables secure, seamless connectivity across multiple Kubernetes clusters. For operators running hybrid or multi-cloud environments, Cluster Mesh ensures a consistent security and connectivity experience.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global service discovery&lt;/strong&gt;: Workloads across clusters can discover and connect to services as if they were local. This enables fault tolerance, like automatically failing over to backends in another cluster, and exposes shared services like logging, auth, or databases across environments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unified identity model:&lt;/strong&gt; Security policies are enforced based on identity, not IP address, across all clusters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Network Policy&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Cilium &lt;code&gt;Network Policy &amp;lt;https://cilium.io/use-cases/network-policy/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_ provides identity-aware enforcement across L3-L7. Typical container firewalls secure workloads by filtering on source IP addresses and destination ports. This concept requires the firewalls on all servers to be manipulated whenever a container is started anywhere in the cluster.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid this situation which limits scale, Cilium assigns a security identity to groups of application containers which share identical security policies. The identity is then associated with all network packets emitted by the application containers, allowing to validate the identity at the receiving node.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity-based security&lt;/strong&gt; removes reliance on brittle IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L3/L4 policies&lt;/strong&gt; restrict traffic based on labels, protocols, and ports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNS-based policies:&lt;/strong&gt; Allow or deny traffic to FQDNs or wildcard domains (e.g., &lt;code&gt;api.example.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*.trusted.com&lt;/code&gt;). This is especially useful for securing egress traffic to third-party services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L7-aware policies&lt;/strong&gt; allow filtering by HTTP method, URL path, gRPC call, and more:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Example: Allow only GET requests to &lt;code&gt;/public/.*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enforce the presence of headers like &lt;code&gt;X-Token: [0-9]+&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;CIDR-based egress and ingress policies are also supported for controlling access to external IPs, ideal for integrating with legacy systems or regulatory boundaries.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Service Mesh&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With Cilium &lt;code&gt;Service Mesh &amp;lt;https://cilium.io/use-cases/service-mesh/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_, operators gain the benefits of fine-grained traffic control, encryption, observability, access control, without the cost and complexity of traditional proxy-based designs. Key features include:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutual authentication&lt;/strong&gt; with automatic identity-based encryption between workloads using IPSec or WireGuard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L7-aware policy enforcement&lt;/strong&gt; for security and compliance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep integration with the Kubernetes Gateway API :&lt;/strong&gt; Acts as a &lt;code&gt;Gateway API &amp;lt;https://cilium.io/use-cases/gateway-api/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;_ compliant data plane, allowing you to declaratively manage ingress, traffic splitting, and routing behavior using Kubernetes-native CRDs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Observability and Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Observability is built into Cilium from the ground up, providing rich visibility that helps operators diagnose and understand system behavior including:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hubble&lt;/strong&gt;: A fully integrated observability platform that offers real-time service maps, flow visibility with identity and label metadata, and DNS-aware filtering and protocol-specific insights&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics and alerting&lt;/strong&gt;: Integration with Prometheus, Grafana, and other monitoring systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drop reasons and audit trails&lt;/strong&gt;: Get actionable insights into why traffic was dropped, including policy or port violations and issues like failed DNS lookups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ready-to-use SRT / WebRTC / RTSP / RTMP / LL-HLS / MPEG-TS / RTP media server and media proxy that allows to read, publish, proxy, record and playback video and audio streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1 align="center"&gt; &lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org"&gt; &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/main/logo.png" alt="MediaMTX" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/website-mediamtx.org-1c94b5" alt="Website" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/actions/workflows/code_test.yml"&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/actions/workflows/code_test.yml/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Test" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/actions/workflows/code_lint.yml"&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/actions/workflows/code_lint.yml/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Lint" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://app.codecov.io/gh/bluenviron/mediamtx/tree/main"&gt;&lt;img src="https://codecov.io/gh/bluenviron/mediamtx/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="CodeCov" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/bluenviron/mediamtx" alt="Release" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bluenviron/mediamtx"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-bluenviron/mediamtx-blue" alt="Docker Hub" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MediaMTX&lt;/em&gt; is a ready-to-use and zero-dependency real-time media server and media proxy that allows to publish, read, proxy, record and playback video and audio streams. It has been conceived as a "media router" that routes media streams from one end to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Features&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/publish"&gt;Publish&lt;/a&gt; live streams to the server with SRT, WebRTC, RTSP, RTMP, HLS, MPEG-TS, RTP&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/read"&gt;Read&lt;/a&gt; live streams from the server with SRT, WebRTC, RTSP, RTMP, HLS&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Streams are automatically converted from a protocol to another&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Serve several streams at once in separate paths&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Reload the configuration without disconnecting existing clients (hot reloading)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/record"&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt; streams to disk in fMP4 or MPEG-TS format&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/playback"&gt;Playback&lt;/a&gt; recorded streams&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/authentication"&gt;Authenticate&lt;/a&gt; users with internal, HTTP or JWT authentication&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/forward"&gt;Forward&lt;/a&gt; streams to other servers&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/proxy"&gt;Proxy&lt;/a&gt; requests to other servers&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/control-api"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; the server through the Control API&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/metrics"&gt;Extract metrics&lt;/a&gt; from the server in a Prometheus-compatible format&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/performance"&gt;Monitor performance&lt;/a&gt; to investigate CPU and RAM consumption&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/usage/hooks"&gt;Run hooks&lt;/a&gt; (external commands) when clients connect, disconnect, read or publish streams&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Compatible with Linux, Windows and macOS, does not require any dependency or interpreter, it's a single executable&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;...and many &lt;a href="https://mediamtx.org/docs/kickoff/introduction"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt; &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/consul/main/website/public/img/logo.svg?sanitize=true" align="left" height="46px" alt="Consul logo" /&gt; &lt;span&gt;Consul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/consul/main/LICENSE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BUSL--1.1-yellow.svg?sanitize=true" alt="License: BUSL-1.1" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/consul"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/hashicorp/consul.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Docker Pulls" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/hashicorp/consul"&gt;&lt;img src="https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/hashicorp/consul" alt="Go Report Card" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Consul is a distributed, highly available, and data center aware solution to connect and configure applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Documentation and Tutorials: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul]&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Forum: &lt;a href="https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/consul"&gt;Discuss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Consul provides several key features:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Datacenter&lt;/strong&gt; - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can support any number of regions without complex configuration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Mesh&lt;/strong&gt; - Consul Service Mesh enables secure service-to-service communication with automatic TLS encryption and identity-based authorization. Applications can use sidecar proxies in a service mesh configuration to establish TLS connections for inbound and outbound connections with Transparent Proxy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API Gateway&lt;/strong&gt; - Consul API Gateway manages access to services within Consul Service Mesh, allow users to define traffic and authorization policies to services deployed within the mesh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; - Consul makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Checking&lt;/strong&gt; - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service level circuit breakers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic App Configuration&lt;/strong&gt; - An HTTP API that allows users to store indexed objects within Consul, for storing configuration parameters and application metadata.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Consul runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Windows and includes an optional &lt;a href="https://demo.consul.io"&gt;browser based UI&lt;/a&gt;. A commercial version called &lt;a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/enterprise"&gt;Consul Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; is also available.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note&lt;/strong&gt;: We take Consul's security and our users' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in Consul, please &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/security#vulnerability-reporting"&gt;responsibly disclose&lt;/a&gt; by contacting us at &lt;a href="mailto:security@hashicorp.com"&gt;security@hashicorp.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and images, volumes mounted into those containers, and pods made from groups of containers. Podman runs containers on Linux, but can also be used on Mac and Windows systems using a Podman-managed virtual machine. Podman is based on libpod, a library for container lifecycle management that is also contained in this repository. The libpod library provides APIs for managing containers, pods, container images, and volumes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Podman releases a new major or minor release 4 times a year, during the second week of February, May, August, and November. Patch releases are more frequent and may occur at any time to get bugfixes out to users. All releases are PGP signed. Public keys of members of the team approved to make releases are located &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/release-keys/tree/main/podman"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Overview and scope&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At a high level, the scope of Podman and libpod is the following:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Support for multiple container image formats, including OCI and Docker images.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Full management of those images, including pulling from various sources (including trust and verification), creating (built via Containerfile or Dockerfile or committed from a container), and pushing to registries and other storage backends.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Full management of container lifecycle, including creation (both from an image and from an exploded root filesystem), running, checkpointing and restoring (via CRIU), and removal.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Full management of container networking, using Netavark.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Support for pods, groups of containers that share resources and are managed together.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Support for running containers and pods without root or other elevated privileges.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Resource isolation of containers and pods.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Support for a Docker-compatible CLI interface, which can both run containers locally and on remote systems.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;No manager daemon, for improved security and lower resource utilization at idle.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Support for a REST API providing both a Docker-compatible interface and an improved interface exposing advanced Podman functionality.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Support for running on Windows and Mac via virtual machines run by &lt;code&gt;podman machine&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Roadmap&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The future of Podman feature development can be found in its &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/podman/main/ROADMAP.md"&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you think you've identified a security issue in the project, please &lt;em&gt;DO NOT&lt;/em&gt; report the issue publicly via the GitHub issue tracker, mailing list, or IRC. Instead, send an email with as many details as possible to &lt;code&gt;security@lists.podman.io&lt;/code&gt;. This is a private mailing list for the core maintainers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For general questions and discussion, please use Podman's &lt;a href="https://podman.io/community/#slack-irc-matrix-and-discord"&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For discussions around issues/bugs and features, you can use the GitHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/podman/issues"&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/podman/pulls"&gt;PRs&lt;/a&gt; tracking system.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;a href="https://lists.podman.io/archives/"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;code&gt;lists.podman.io&lt;/code&gt;. You can subscribe by sending a message to &lt;code&gt;podman-join@lists.podman.io&lt;/code&gt; with the subject &lt;code&gt;subscribe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Rootless&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Podman can be easily run as a normal user, without requiring a setuid binary. When run without root, Podman containers use user namespaces to set root in the container to the user running Podman. Rootless Podman runs locked-down containers with no privileges that the user running the container does not have. Some of these restrictions can be lifted (via &lt;code&gt;--privileged&lt;/code&gt;, for example), but rootless containers will never have more privileges than the user that launched them. If you run Podman as your user and mount in &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; from the host, you still won't be able to change it, since your user doesn't have permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Almost all normal Podman functionality is available, though there are some &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/podman/raw/main/rootless.md"&gt;shortcomings&lt;/a&gt;. Any recent Podman release should be able to run rootless without any additional configuration, though your operating system may require some additional configuration detailed in the &lt;a href="https://podman.io/getting-started/installation"&gt;install guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A little configuration by an administrator is required before rootless Podman can be used, the necessary setup is documented &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/podman/raw/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Podman Desktop&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://podman-desktop.io/"&gt;Podman Desktop&lt;/a&gt; provides a local development environment for Podman and Kubernetes on Linux, Windows, and Mac machines. It is a full-featured desktop UI frontend for Podman which uses the &lt;code&gt;podman machine&lt;/code&gt; backend on non-Linux operating systems to run containers. It supports full container lifecycle management (building, pulling, and pushing images, creating and managing containers, creating and managing pods, and working with Kubernetes YAML). The project develops on &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and contributions are welcome.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Out of scope&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Specialized signing and pushing of images to various storage backends. See &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo/"&gt;Skopeo&lt;/a&gt; for those tasks.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Support for the Kubernetes CRI interface for container management. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o"&gt;CRI-O&lt;/a&gt; daemon specializes in that.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;OCI Projects Plans&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Podman uses OCI projects and best of breed libraries for different aspects:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Runtime: We use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools"&gt;OCI runtime tools&lt;/a&gt; to generate OCI runtime configurations that can be used with any OCI-compliant runtime, like &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/crun/"&gt;crun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/"&gt;runc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Images: Image management uses the &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/image"&gt;containers/image&lt;/a&gt; library.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Storage: Container and image storage is managed by &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/storage"&gt;containers/storage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Networking: Networking support through use of &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/netavark"&gt;Netavark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns"&gt;Aardvark&lt;/a&gt;. Rootless networking is handled via &lt;a href="https://passt.top/passt"&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns"&gt;slirp4netns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Builds: Builds are supported via &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah"&gt;Buildah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Conmon: &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/conmon"&gt;Conmon&lt;/a&gt; is a tool for monitoring OCI runtimes, used by both Podman and CRI-O.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Seccomp: A unified &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/common/raw/main/pkg/seccomp/seccomp.json"&gt;Seccomp&lt;/a&gt; policy for Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containers/podman/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;Contributing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Information about contributing to this project.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Buildah and Podman relationship&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Buildah and Podman are two complementary open-source projects that are available on most Linux platforms and both projects reside at &lt;a href="https://github.com"&gt;GitHub.com&lt;/a&gt; with Buildah &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Podman &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/podman"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Both, Buildah and Podman are command line tools that work on Open Container Initiative (OCI) images and containers. The two projects differentiate in their specialization.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Buildah specializes in building OCI images. Buildah's commands replicate all of the commands that are found in a Dockerfile. This allows building images with and without Dockerfiles while not requiring any root privileges. Buildah’s ultimate goal is to provide a lower-level coreutils interface to build images. The flexibility of building images without Dockerfiles allows for the integration of other scripting languages into the build process. Buildah follows a simple fork-exec model and does not run as a daemon but it is based on a comprehensive API in golang, which can be vendored into other tools.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Podman specializes in all of the commands and functions that help you to maintain and modify OCI images, such as pulling and tagging. It also allows you to create, run, and maintain those containers created from those images. For building container images via Dockerfiles, Podman uses Buildah's golang API and can be installed independently from Buildah.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A major difference between Podman and Buildah is their concept of a container. Podman allows users to create "traditional containers" where the intent of these containers is to be long lived. While Buildah containers are really just created to allow content to be added back to the container image. An easy way to think of it is the &lt;code&gt;buildah run&lt;/code&gt; command emulates the RUN command in a Dockerfile while the &lt;code&gt;podman run&lt;/code&gt; command emulates the &lt;code&gt;docker run&lt;/code&gt; command in functionality. Because of this and their underlying storage differences, you can not see Podman containers from within Buildah or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In short, Buildah is an efficient way to create OCI images while Podman allows you to manage and maintain those images and containers in a production environment using familiar container cli commands. For more details, see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/containers/buildah/tree/main/docs/containertools"&gt;Container Tools Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenTelemetry Collector&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;hr /&gt; 
&lt;p align="center"&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;Getting Involved&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W"&gt;Getting In Touch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p align="center"&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml?query=branch%3Amain"&gt; &lt;img alt="Build Status" src="https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/build-and-test.yml?branch=main&amp;amp;style=for-the-badge" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector"&gt; &lt;img alt="Go Report Card" src="https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector?style=for-the-badge" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://codecov.io/gh/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/branch/main/"&gt; &lt;img alt="Codecov Status" src="https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector?style=for-the-badge" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/releases"&gt; &lt;img alt="GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)" src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector?include_prereleases&amp;amp;style=for-the-badge" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/8404"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/8404/badge" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?sort=-opened&amp;amp;can=1&amp;amp;q=proj:opentelemetry"&gt; &lt;img alt="Fuzzing Status" src="https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/badges/opentelemetry.svg?sanitize=true" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p align="center"&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/main/docs/vision.md"&gt;Vision&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/"&gt;Configuration&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/internal-telemetry/#use-internal-telemetry-to-monitor-the-collector"&gt;Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/main/docs/security-best-practices.md"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/collector"&gt;Package&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;hr /&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img src="https://opentelemetry.io/img/logos/opentelemetry-logo-nav.png" alt="OpenTelemetry Icon" width="45" height="" /&gt; OpenTelemetry Collector&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive, process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need to run, operate and maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support open-source telemetry data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Objectives:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Usable: Reasonable default configuration, supports popular protocols, runs and collects out of the box.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Performant: Highly stable and performant under varying loads and configurations.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Observable: An exemplar of an observable service.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Extensible: Customizable without touching the core code.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Unified: Single codebase, deployable as an agent or collector with support for traces, metrics and logs.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The OpenTelemetry Collector SIG is present at the &lt;a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01N6P7KR6W"&gt;#otel-collector&lt;/a&gt; channel on the CNCF Slack and &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#implementation-sigs"&gt;meets once a week&lt;/a&gt; via video calls. Everyone is invited to join those calls, which typically serves the following purposes:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;meet the humans behind the project&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;get an opinion about specific proposals&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;look for a sponsor for a proposed component after trying already via GitHub and Slack&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;get attention to a specific pull-request that got stuck and is difficult to discuss asynchronously&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We rotate our video calls between three time slots, in order to allow everyone to join at least once every three meetings. The rotation order is as follows:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=1700"&gt;17:00 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0900"&gt;09:00 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://dateful.com/convert/pst-pdt-pacific-time?t=0500"&gt;05:00 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Contributors to the project are also welcome to have ad-hoc meetings for synchronous discussions about specific points. Post a note in #otel-collector-dev on Slack inviting others, specifying the topic to be discussed. Unless there are strong reasons to keep the meeting private, please make it an open invitation for other contributors to join. Try also to identify who would be the other contributors interested on that topic and in which timezones they are.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Remember that our source of truth is GitHub: every decision made via Slack or video calls has to be recorded in the relevant GitHub issue. Ideally, the agenda items from the meeting notes would include a link to the issue or pull request where a discussion is happening already. We acknowledge that not everyone can join Slack or the synchronous calls and don't want them to feel excluded.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Supported OTLP version&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This code base is currently built against using OTLP protocol v1.5.0, considered Stable. &lt;a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto?tab=readme-ov-file#stability-definition"&gt;See the OpenTelemetry Protocol Stability definition here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Stability levels&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/main/docs/component-stability.md"&gt;Stability Levels and versioning&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When used as a library, the OpenTelemetry Collector attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as &lt;a href="https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy"&gt;defined by the Go team&lt;/a&gt;. Removing support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Support for Go versions on the OpenTelemetry Collector is updated as follows:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The first release after the release of a new Go minor version &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; will add build and tests steps for the new Go minor version.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The first release after the release of a new Go minor version &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; will remove support for Go version &lt;code&gt;N-2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Official OpenTelemetry Collector distro binaries will be built with a release in the latest Go minor version series.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Verifying the images signatures&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;[!NOTE] To verify a signed artifact or blob, first &lt;a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/"&gt;install Cosign&lt;/a&gt;, then follow the instructions below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We are signing the images &lt;code&gt;otel/opentelemetry-collector&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;a href="https://github.com/sigstore/cosign"&gt;sigstore cosign&lt;/a&gt; tool and to verify the signatures you can run the following command:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;$ cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity=https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/.github/workflows/base-release.yaml@refs/tags/&amp;lt;RELEASE_TAG&amp;gt; \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  &amp;lt;OTEL_COLLECTOR_IMAGE&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The gRPC-Gateway is a plugin of the Google protocol buffers compiler &lt;a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf"&gt;protoc&lt;/a&gt;. It reads protobuf service definitions and generates a reverse-proxy server which translates a RESTful HTTP API into gRPC. This server is generated according to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/raw/master/google/api/http.proto#L46"&gt;&lt;code&gt;google.api.http&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; annotations in your service definitions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This helps you provide your APIs in both gRPC and RESTful style at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div align="center"&gt; 
 &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/main/docs/assets/images/architecture_introduction_diagram.svg?sanitize=true" /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Docs&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can read our docs at:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/"&gt;https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Testimonials&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;We use the gRPC-Gateway to serve millions of API requests per day, and have been since 2018 and through all of that, we have never had any issues with it.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- William Mill, &lt;a href="http://adhocteam.us/"&gt;Ad Hoc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;gRPC is great -- it generates API clients and server stubs in many programming languages, it is fast, easy-to-use, bandwidth-efficient and its design is combat-proven by Google. However, you might still want to provide a traditional RESTful JSON API as well. Reasons can range from maintaining backward-compatibility, supporting languages or clients that are not well supported by gRPC, to simply maintaining the aesthetics and tooling involved with a RESTful JSON architecture.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to provide that HTTP+JSON interface to your gRPC service. A small amount of configuration in your service to attach HTTP semantics is all that's needed to generate a reverse-proxy with this library.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Compile from source&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following instructions assume you are using &lt;a href="https://go.dev/wiki/Modules"&gt;Go Modules&lt;/a&gt; for dependency management. Use a &lt;a href="https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module"&gt;tool dependency&lt;/a&gt; to track the versions of the following executable packages:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;// +build tools

package tools

import (
    _ "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway"
    _ "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2"
    _ "google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc"
    _ "google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go"
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;go mod tidy&lt;/code&gt; to resolve the versions. Install by running&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;go install \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway \
    github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2 \
    google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go \
    google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This will place four binaries in your &lt;code&gt;$GOBIN&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-openapiv2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-go-grpc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that your &lt;code&gt;$GOBIN&lt;/code&gt; is in your &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;tool&lt;/code&gt; Directive in Go 1.24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Starting from Go 1.24, the &lt;code&gt;tool&lt;/code&gt; directive in &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; provides a structured way to track and manage executable dependencies. This replaces the previous workaround of using a separate &lt;code&gt;tools.go&lt;/code&gt; file with blank imports.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking Tools in &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead of manually importing tool dependencies in a Go source file, you can now use the &lt;code&gt;tool&lt;/code&gt; directive in &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; to declare the tools your project depends on. For example:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;module tools

go 1.24

tool (
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
	github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
	google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
	google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Tool Dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To add tools to your module, use the &lt;code&gt;-tool&lt;/code&gt; flag with &lt;code&gt;go get&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
go get -tool github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/protoc-gen-openapiv2
go get -tool google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go
go get -tool google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This automatically updates &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt;, adding the tools under the &lt;code&gt;tool&lt;/code&gt; directive along with &lt;code&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; statements to ensure version tracking.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Install Tools&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once the tool dependencies are properly recorded in the &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt; file, simply execute the following command in the root directory of your project:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;go install tool
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This will place four binaries in your &lt;code&gt;$GOBIN&lt;/code&gt;;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-openapiv2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-go&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-go-grpc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that your &lt;code&gt;$GOBIN&lt;/code&gt; is in your &lt;code&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Download the binaries&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You may alternatively download the binaries from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest"&gt;GitHub releases page&lt;/a&gt;. We generate &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/main/slsa.dev"&gt;SLSA3 signatures&lt;/a&gt; using the OpenSSF's &lt;a href="https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator"&gt;slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator&lt;/a&gt; during the release process. To verify a release binary:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Install the verification tool from &lt;a href="https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation"&gt;slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#installation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Download the provenance file &lt;code&gt;attestation.intoto.jsonl&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/releases/latest"&gt;GitHub releases page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Run the verifier:&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;slsa-verifier -artifact-path &amp;lt;the-binary&amp;gt; -provenance attestation.intoto.jsonl -source github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway -tag &amp;lt;the-tag&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, see the section on remotely managed plugin versions below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;1.Define your &lt;a href="https://grpc.io/docs/"&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; service using protocol buffers&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;your_service.proto&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-protobuf"&gt; syntax = "proto3";
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = "github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1";

 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
   rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;2. Generate gRPC stubs&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This step generates the gRPC stubs that you can use to implement the service and consume from clients:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example &lt;code&gt;buf.gen.yaml&lt;/code&gt; you can use to generate the stubs with &lt;a href="https://github.com/bufbuild/buf"&gt;buf&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With this file in place, you can generate your files using &lt;code&gt;buf generate&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;For a complete example of using &lt;code&gt;buf generate&lt;/code&gt; to generate protobuf stubs, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate"&gt;the boilerplate repo&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on generating the stubs with buf, see &lt;a href="https://docs.buf.build/generate-usage"&gt;the official documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; to generate stubs, here's an example of what a command might look like:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;protoc -I . \
    --go_out ./gen/go/ --go_opt paths=source_relative \
    --go-grpc_out ./gen/go/ --go-grpc_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;3. Implement your service in gRPC as usual.&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;4. Generate reverse-proxy using &lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-grpc-gateway&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you have 3 options:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;no further modifications, use the default mapping to HTTP semantics (method, path, etc.) 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;this will work on any &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file, but will not allow setting HTTP paths, request parameters or similar&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;additional &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; modifications to use a custom mapping 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;relies on parameters in the &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file to set custom HTTP mappings&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;no &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; modifications, but use an external configuration file 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;relies on an external configuration file to set custom HTTP mappings&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;mostly useful when the source proto file isn't under your control&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;1. Using the default mapping&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This requires no additional modification to the &lt;code&gt;.proto&lt;/code&gt; file but does require enabling a specific option when executing the plugin. The &lt;code&gt;generate_unbound_methods&lt;/code&gt; should be enabled.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's what a &lt;code&gt;buf.gen.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file might look like with this option enabled:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; (just the grpc-gateway stubs):&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt generate_unbound_methods=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;2. With custom annotations&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;a href="https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/raw/master/google/api/http.proto#L46"&gt;&lt;code&gt;google.api.http&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; annotation to your .proto file&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;your_service.proto&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-diff"&gt; syntax = "proto3";
 package your.service.v1;
 option go_package = "github.com/yourorg/yourprotos/gen/go/your/service/v1";
+
+import "google/api/annotations.proto";
+
 message StringMessage {
   string value = 1;
 }

 service YourService {
-  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {}
+  rpc Echo(StringMessage) returns (StringMessage) {
+    option (google.api.http) = {
+      post: "/v1/example/echo"
+      body: "*"
+    };
+  }
 }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;You will need to provide the required third party protobuf files to the protobuf compiler. If you are using &lt;a href="https://github.com/bufbuild/buf"&gt;buf&lt;/a&gt;, this dependency can be added to the &lt;code&gt;deps&lt;/code&gt; array in your &lt;code&gt;buf.yaml&lt;/code&gt; under the name &lt;code&gt;buf.build/googleapis/googleapis&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;version: v2
name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Always run &lt;code&gt;buf dep update&lt;/code&gt; after adding a dependency to your &lt;code&gt;buf.yaml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/main/examples/internal/proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto"&gt;a_bit_of_everything.proto&lt;/a&gt; for examples of more annotations you can add to customize gateway behavior and generated OpenAPI output.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's what a &lt;code&gt;buf.gen.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file might look like:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; to generate stubs, you need to ensure the required dependencies are available to the compiler at compile time. These can be found by manually cloning and copying the relevant files from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis"&gt;googleapis repository&lt;/a&gt;, and providing them to &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; when running. The files you will need are:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;google/api/annotations.proto
google/api/field_behavior.proto
google/api/http.proto
google/api/httpbody.proto
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's what a &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; execution might look like:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;3. External configuration&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you do not want to (or cannot) modify the proto file for use with gRPC-Gateway you can alternatively use an external &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config"&gt;gRPC Service Configuration&lt;/a&gt; file. &lt;a href="https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/"&gt;Check our documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information. This is best combined with the &lt;code&gt;standalone=true&lt;/code&gt; option to generate a file that can live in its own package, separate from the files generated by the source protobuf file.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's what a &lt;code&gt;buf.gen.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file might look like with this option enabled:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; (just the grpc-gateway stubs):&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;protoc -I . --grpc-gateway_out ./gen/go \
    --grpc-gateway_opt paths=source_relative \
    --grpc-gateway_opt grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml \
    --grpc-gateway_opt standalone=true \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;5. Write an entrypoint for the HTTP reverse-proxy server&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;package main

import (
  "context"
  "flag"
  "net/http"

  "github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2/runtime"
  "google.golang.org/grpc"
  "google.golang.org/grpc/credentials/insecure"
  "google.golang.org/grpc/grpclog"

  gw "github.com/yourorg/yourrepo/proto/gen/go/your/service/v1/your_service"  // Update
)

var (
  // command-line options:
  // gRPC server endpoint
  grpcServerEndpoint = flag.String("grpc-server-endpoint",  "localhost:9090", "gRPC server endpoint")
)

func run() error {
  ctx := context.Background()
  ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
  defer cancel()

  // Register gRPC server endpoint
  // Note: Make sure the gRPC server is running properly and accessible
  mux := runtime.NewServeMux()
  opts := []grpc.DialOption{grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials())}
  err := gw.RegisterYourServiceHandlerFromEndpoint(ctx, mux,  *grpcServerEndpoint, opts)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }

  // Start HTTP server (and proxy calls to gRPC server endpoint)
  return http.ListenAndServe(":8081", mux)
}

func main() {
  flag.Parse()

  if err := run(); err != nil {
    grpclog.Fatal(err)
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;6. (Optional) Generate OpenAPI definitions using &lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-openapiv2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here's what a &lt;code&gt;buf.gen.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file might look like:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-go
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-go-grpc
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - generate_unbound_methods=true
  - local: protoc-gen-openapiv2
    out: gen/go
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To use the custom protobuf annotations supported by &lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-openapiv2&lt;/code&gt;, we need another dependency added to our protobuf generation step. If you are using &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt;, you can add the &lt;code&gt;buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway&lt;/code&gt; dependency to your &lt;code&gt;deps&lt;/code&gt; array:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;version: v2
name: buf.build/yourorg/myprotos
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/googleapis
  - buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; (just the swagger file):&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;protoc -I . --openapiv2_out ./gen/openapiv2 \
    your/service/v1/your_service.proto
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; to generate stubs, you will need to copy the protobuf files from the &lt;code&gt;protoc-gen-openapiv2/options&lt;/code&gt; directory of this repository, and providing them to &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; when running.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Note that this plugin also supports generating OpenAPI definitions for unannotated methods; use the &lt;code&gt;generate_unbound_methods&lt;/code&gt; option to enable this.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is possible with the HTTP mapping for a gRPC service method to create duplicate mappings with the only difference being constraints on the path parameter.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/v1/{name=projects/*}&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/v1/{name=organizations/*}&lt;/code&gt; both become &lt;code&gt;/v1/{name}&lt;/code&gt;. When this occurs the plugin will rename the path parameter with a "_1" (or "_2" etc) suffix to differentiate the different operations. So in the above example, the 2nd path would become &lt;code&gt;/v1/{name_1=organizations/*}&lt;/code&gt;. This can also cause OpenAPI clients to URL encode the "/" that is part of the path parameter as that is what OpenAPI defines in the specification. To allow gRPC gateway to accept the URL encoded slash and still route the request, use the UnescapingModeAllCharacters or UnescapingModeLegacy (which is the default currently though may change in future versions). See &lt;a href="https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/customizing_your_gateway/"&gt;Customizing Your Gateway&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Usage with remote plugins&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to all of the above, you can use &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;a href="https://buf.build/docs/bsr/remote-plugins/usage"&gt;remote plugins&lt;/a&gt; to manage plugin versions and generation. An example &lt;code&gt;buf.gen.yaml&lt;/code&gt; using remote plugin generation looks like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;version: v2
plugins:
  - remote: buf.build/protocolbuffers/go:v1.31.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc/go:v1.3.0
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/gateway:v2.16.2
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
  - remote: buf.build/grpc-ecosystem/openapiv2:v2.16.2
    out: gen/openapiv2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This requires no local installation of any plugins. Be careful to use the same version of the generator as the runtime library, i.e. if using &lt;code&gt;v2.16.2&lt;/code&gt;, run&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;$ go get github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/v2@v2.16.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get the same version of the runtime in your &lt;code&gt;go.mod&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Note that usage of remote plugins is incompatible with usage of external configuration files like &lt;a href="https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/grpc_api_configuration/#using-an-external-configuration-file"&gt;grpc_api_configuration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Video intro&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This GopherCon UK 2019 presentation from our maintainer &lt;a href="https://github.com/johanbrandhorst"&gt;@JohanBrandhorst&lt;/a&gt; provides a good intro to using the gRPC-Gateway. It uses the following boilerplate repo as a base: &lt;a href="https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate"&gt;https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;div align="center"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq1paKC-fXk"&gt; &lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Pq1paKC-fXk/0.jpg" /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Parameters and flags&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; to generate stubs, flags and parameters are passed through the &lt;code&gt;opt&lt;/code&gt; field in your &lt;code&gt;buf.gen.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file, for example:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt;version: v2
plugins:
  - local: protoc-gen-grpc-gateway
    out: gen/go
    opt:
      - paths=source_relative
      - grpc_api_configuration=path/to/config.yaml
      - standalone=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;During code generation with &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt;, flags to gRPC-Gateway tools must be passed through &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; using one of 2 patterns:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;as part of the &lt;code&gt;--&amp;lt;tool_suffix&amp;gt;_out&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;protoc&lt;/code&gt; parameter: &lt;code&gt;--&amp;lt;tool_suffix&amp;gt;_out=&amp;lt;flags&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;--grpc-gateway_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
--openapiv2_out=repeated_path_param_separator=ssv:.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;using additional &lt;code&gt;--&amp;lt;tool_suffix&amp;gt;_opt&lt;/code&gt; parameters: &lt;code&gt;--&amp;lt;tool_suffix&amp;gt;_opt=&amp;lt;flag&amp;gt;[,&amp;lt;flag&amp;gt;]*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;--grpc-gateway_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
--openapiv2_opt repeated_path_param_separator=ssv
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;More examples&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;More examples are available under the &lt;code&gt;examples&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/echo_service.proto&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.proto&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/unannotated_echo_service.proto&lt;/code&gt;: service definition 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/echo_service.pb.go&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.pb.go&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/unannotated_echo_service.pb.go&lt;/code&gt;: [generated] stub of the service&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/echo_service.pb.gw.go&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/a_bit_of_everything.pb.gw.go&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/uannotated_echo_service.pb.gw.go&lt;/code&gt;: [generated] reverse proxy for the service&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;proto/examplepb/unannotated_echo_service.yaml&lt;/code&gt;: gRPC API Configuration for &lt;code&gt;unannotated_echo_service.proto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;server/main.go&lt;/code&gt;: service implementation&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;main.go&lt;/code&gt;: entrypoint of the generated reverse proxy&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To use the same port for custom HTTP handlers (e.g. serving &lt;code&gt;swagger.json&lt;/code&gt;), gRPC-Gateway, and a gRPC server, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/philips/grpc-gateway-example/raw/master/cmd/serve.go"&gt;this example by CoreOS&lt;/a&gt; (and its accompanying &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201112010739/https://coreos.com/blog/grpc-protobufs-swagger.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mynalabsai/grpc_gateway_media_example"&gt;This example by neiro.ai&lt;/a&gt; (and its accompanying &lt;a href="https://medium.com/neiro-ai/grpc-gateway-for-media-api-by-neiro-9033caab12c8"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;) shows how mediafiles using &lt;code&gt;multipart/form-data&lt;/code&gt; can be integrated into rpc messages using a middleware.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Supported&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Generating JSON API handlers.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Method parameters in the request body.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Method parameters in the request path.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Method parameters in the query string.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Enum fields in the path parameter (including repeated enum fields).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Mapping streaming APIs to newline-delimited JSON streams.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Mapping HTTP headers with &lt;code&gt;Grpc-Metadata-&lt;/code&gt; prefix to gRPC metadata (prefixed with &lt;code&gt;grpcgateway-&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Optionally emitting API definitions for &lt;a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/"&gt;OpenAPI (Swagger) v2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Setting &lt;a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc/raw/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md#requests"&gt;gRPC timeouts&lt;/a&gt; through inbound HTTP &lt;code&gt;Grpc-Timeout&lt;/code&gt; header.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Partial support for &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/grpc-service-config"&gt;gRPC API Configuration&lt;/a&gt; files as an alternative to annotation.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Automatically translating PATCH requests into Field Mask gRPC requests. See &lt;a href="https://grpc-ecosystem.github.io/grpc-gateway/docs/mapping/patch_feature/"&gt;the docs&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://protobuf.dev/editions/overview/"&gt;Protobuf Editions&lt;/a&gt; support (edition 2023).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Go &lt;a href="https://go.dev/blog/protobuf-opaque"&gt;Opaque API&lt;/a&gt; support.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;No plan to support&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But patches are welcome.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Method parameters in HTTP headers.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Handling trailer metadata.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Encoding request/response body in XML.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;True bi-directional streaming.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Mapping gRPC to HTTP&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/raw/main/runtime/errors.go#L15"&gt;How gRPC error codes map to HTTP status codes in the response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;HTTP request source IP is added as &lt;code&gt;X-Forwarded-For&lt;/code&gt; gRPC request header.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;HTTP request host is added as &lt;code&gt;X-Forwarded-Host&lt;/code&gt; gRPC request header.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;HTTP &lt;code&gt;Authorization&lt;/code&gt; header is added as &lt;code&gt;authorization&lt;/code&gt; gRPC request header.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Remaining Permanent HTTP header keys (as specified by the IANA &lt;a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;grpcgateway-&lt;/code&gt; and added with their values to gRPC request header.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;HTTP headers that start with 'Grpc-Metadata-' are mapped to gRPC metadata (prefixed with &lt;code&gt;grpcgateway-&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;While configurable, the default {un,}marshaling uses &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson"&gt;protojson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The path template used to map gRPC service methods to HTTP endpoints supports the &lt;a href="https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/raw/master/google/api/http.proto"&gt;google.api.http&lt;/a&gt; path template syntax. For example, &lt;code&gt;/api/v1/{name=projects/*/topics/*}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/prefix/{path=organizations/**}&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;💥 A Lodash-style Go library based on Go 1.18+ Generics (map, filter, contains, find...)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;lo - Iterate over slices, maps, channels...&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/samber/lo/releases"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/github/tag/samber/lo.svg?sanitize=true" alt="tag" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-%3E%3D%201.18-%23007d9c" alt="Go Version" /&gt; &lt;a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/samber/lo"&gt;&lt;img src="https://godoc.org/github.com/samber/lo?status.svg?sanitize=true" alt="GoDoc" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src="https://github.com/samber/lo/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Build Status" /&gt; &lt;a href="https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/samber/lo"&gt;&lt;img src="https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/samber/lo" alt="Go report" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://codecov.io/gh/samber/lo"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/samber/lo" alt="Coverage" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/samber/lo/graphs/contributors"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/samber/lo" alt="Contributors" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samber/lo/master/LICENSE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/github/license/samber/lo" alt="License" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;✨ &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;samber/lo&lt;/code&gt; is a Lodash-style Go library based on Go 1.18+ Generics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A utility library based on Go 1.18+ generics that makes it easier to work with slices, maps, strings, channels, and functions. It provides dozens of handy methods to simplify common coding tasks and improve code readability. It may look like &lt;a href="https://github.com/lodash/lodash"&gt;Lodash&lt;/a&gt; in some aspects.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;5 to 10 helpers may overlap with those from the Go standard library, in packages &lt;code&gt;slices&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;maps&lt;/code&gt;. I feel this library is legitimate and offers many more valuable abstractions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/samber/do"&gt;samber/do&lt;/a&gt;: A dependency injection toolkit based on Go 1.18+ Generics&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/samber/mo"&gt;samber/mo&lt;/a&gt;: Monads based on Go 1.18+ Generics (Option, Result, Either...)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;hr /&gt; 
&lt;h3 align="center"&gt;💖 Support This Project&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p align="center"&gt; I’m going all-in on open-source for the coming months. &lt;br /&gt; Help sustain development: Become an &lt;a href="http://github.com/sponsors/samber"&gt;individual sponsor&lt;/a&gt; or join as a &lt;a href="mailto:hey@samuel-berthe.fr"&gt;corporate sponsor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;hr /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I wanted a &lt;strong&gt;short name&lt;/strong&gt;, similar to "Lodash", and no Go package uses this name.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samber/lo/master/img/logo-full.png" alt="lo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;🚀 Install&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;go get github.com/samber/lo@v1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This library is v1 and follows SemVer strictly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;No breaking changes will be made to exported APIs before v2.0.0.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This library has no dependencies outside the Go standard library.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;💡 Usage&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can import &lt;code&gt;lo&lt;/code&gt; using:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import (
    "github.com/samber/lo"
    lop "github.com/samber/lo/parallel"
    lom "github.com/samber/lo/mutable"
    loi "github.com/samber/lo/it"
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then use one of the helpers below:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;names := lo.Uniq([]string{"Samuel", "John", "Samuel"})
// []string{"Samuel", "John"}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Tips for lazy developers&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I cannot recommend it, but in case you are too lazy for repeating &lt;code&gt;lo.&lt;/code&gt; everywhere, you can import the entire library into the namespace.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import (
    . "github.com/samber/lo"
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I take no responsibility for this junk. 😁 💩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/Apjg3WeSi7K"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Mutable: like &lt;code&gt;lo.Filter()&lt;/code&gt;, but the slice is updated in place.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import lom "github.com/samber/lo/mutable"

list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}

newList
// []int{2, 4}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Map&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Manipulates a slice of one type and transforms it into a slice of another type:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import "github.com/samber/lo"

lo.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, index int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)

// []string{"1", "2", "3", "4"}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/OkPcYAhBo0D"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Parallel processing: like &lt;code&gt;lo.Map()&lt;/code&gt;, but the mapper function is called in a goroutine. Results are returned in the same order.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import lop "github.com/samber/lo/parallel"

lop.Map([]int64{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int64, _ int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(x, 10)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/0jY3Z0B7O_5"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;UniqMap&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Manipulates a slice and transforms it to a slice of another type with unique values.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;type User struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
users := []User{{Name: "Alex", Age: 10}, {Name: "Alex", Age: 12}, {Name: "Bob", Age: 11}, {Name: "Alice", Age: 20}}

names := lo.UniqMap(users, func(u User, index int) string {

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/fygzLBhvUdB"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;FilterMap&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns a slice obtained after both filtering and mapping using the given callback function.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The callback function should return two values: the result of the mapping operation and whether the result element should be included or not.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;matching := lo.FilterMap([]string{"cpu", "gpu", "mouse", "keyboard"}, func(x string, _ int) (string, bool) {
    if strings.HasSuffix(x, "pu") {
        return "xpu", true
    }
    return "", false
})
// []string{"xpu", "xpu"}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/-AuYXfy7opz"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;FlatMap&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Manipulates a slice and transforms and flattens it to a slice of another type. The transform function can either return a slice or a &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;, and in the &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; case no value is added to the final slice.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;lo.FlatMap([]int64{0, 1, 2}, func(x int64, _ int) []string {
    return []string{
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
        strconv.FormatInt(x, 10),
    }
})
// []string{"0", "0", "1", "1", "2", "2"}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/YSoYmQTA8-U"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Reduce&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Reduces a collection to a single value. The value is calculated by accumulating the result of running each element in the collection through an accumulator function. Each successive invocation is supplied with the return value returned by the previous call.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;sum := lo.Reduce([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(agg int, item int, _ int) int {
    return agg + item
}, 0)
// 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/R4UHXZNaaUG"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;ReduceRight&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;code&gt;lo.Reduce&lt;/code&gt; except that it iterates over elements of collection from right to left.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;result := lo.ReduceRight([][]int{{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}}, func(agg []int, item []int, _ int) []int {
    return append(agg, item...)
}, []int{})
// []int{4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/Fq3W70l7wXF"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;ForEach&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Iterates over elements of a collection and invokes the function over each element.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import "github.com/samber/lo"

lo.ForEach([]string{"hello", "world"}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints "hello\nworld\n"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/oofyiUPRf8t"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Parallel processing: like &lt;code&gt;lo.ForEach()&lt;/code&gt;, but the callback is called as a goroutine.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import lop "github.com/samber/lo/parallel"

lop.ForEach([]string{"hello", "world"}, func(x string, _ int) {
    println(x)
})
// prints "hello\nworld\n" or "world\nhello\n"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;ForEachWhile&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Iterates over collection elements and invokes iteratee for each element collection return value decide to continue or break, like do while().&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;list := []int64{1, 2, -42, 4}

lo.ForEachWhile(list, func(x int64, _ int) bool {
	if x &amp;lt; 0 {
		return false
	}
	fmt.Println(x)
	return true
})
// 1
// 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/QnLGt35tnow"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Times&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Times invokes the iteratee n times, returning a slice of the results of each invocation. The iteratee is invoked with index as argument.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import "github.com/samber/lo"

lo.Times(3, func(i int) string {
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(i), 10)
})
// []string{"0", "1", "2"}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/vgQj3Glr6lT"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Parallel processing: like &lt;code&gt;lo.Times()&lt;/code&gt;, but callback is called in goroutine.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import lop "github.com/samber/lo/parallel"

lop.Times(3, func(i int) string {

})
// []string{"0", "1", "2"}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Uniq&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;uniqValues := lo.Uniq([]int{1, 2, 2, 1})
// []int{1, 2}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;UniqBy&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns a duplicate-free version of a slice, in which only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the slice. It accepts &lt;code&gt;iteratee&lt;/code&gt; which is invoked for each element in the slice to generate the criterion by which uniqueness is computed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;uniqValues := lo.UniqBy([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, func(i int) int {

&lt;h3&gt;Chunk&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns a slice of elements split into groups of length size. If the slice can't be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Keyify&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns a map with each unique element of the slice as a key.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;set := lo.Keyify([]int{1, 1, 2, 3, 4})

&lt;h3&gt;Drop&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Drops n elements from the beginning of a slice.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;l := lo.Drop([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 2)
// []int{2, 3, 4, 5}

&lt;h3&gt;DropRight&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Drops n elements from the end of a slice.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;l := lo.DropRight([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 2)
// []int{0, 1, 2, 3}

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/GG0nXkSJJa3"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;DropWhile&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Drop elements from the beginning of a slice while the predicate returns true.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;l := lo.DropWhile([]string{"a", "aa", "aaa", "aa", "aa"}, func(val string) bool {
    return len(val) &amp;lt;= 2

&lt;h3&gt;DropRightWhile&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Drop elements from the end of a slice while the predicate returns true.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;l := lo.DropRightWhile([]string{"a", "aa", "aaa", "aa", "aa"}, func(val string) bool {

&lt;h3&gt;DropByIndex&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Drops elements from a slice by the index. A negative index will drop elements from the end of the slice.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;l := lo.DropByIndex([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 2, 4, -1)

&lt;h3&gt;Reject&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The opposite of Filter, this method returns the elements of collection that predicate does not return true for.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;odd := lo.Reject([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int, _ int) bool {

&lt;h3&gt;RejectMap&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The opposite of FilterMap, this method returns a slice obtained after both filtering and mapping using the given callback function.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The callback function should return two values:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;the result of the mapping operation and&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;whether the result element should be included or not.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;items := lo.RejectMap([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int, _ int) (int, bool) {
    return x*10, x%2 == 0
})
// []int{10, 30}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;FilterReject&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Mixes Filter and Reject, this method returns two slices, one for the elements of collection that predicate returns true for and one for the elements that predicate does not return true for.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;kept, rejected := lo.FilterReject([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int, _ int) bool {
    return x%2 == 0

// []int{2, 4}
// []int{1, 3}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Count&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Counts the number of elements in the collection that equal value.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;count := lo.Count([]int{1, 5, 1}, 1)
// 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/Y3FlK54yveC"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;CountBy&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Counts the number of elements in the collection for which predicate is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;CountValues&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Counts the number of each element in the collection.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;lo.CountValues([]int{})
// map[int]int{}

lo.CountValues([]int{1, 2})
// map[int]int{1: 1, 2: 1}

lo.CountValues([]int{1, 2, 2})
// map[int]int{1: 1, 2: 2}

lo.CountValues([]string{"foo", "bar", ""})

&lt;h3&gt;CountValuesBy&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Counts the number of each element in the collection. It is equivalent to chaining lo.Map and lo.CountValues.&lt;/p&gt;

// map[bool]int{false: 1, true: 2}

length := func(v string) int {

lo.CountValuesBy([]string{"foo", "bar", ""}, length)
// map[int]int{0: 1, 3: 2}

lo.CountValuesBy([]string{"foo", "bar", "bar"}, length)

&lt;h3&gt;Splice&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Splice inserts multiple elements at index i. A negative index counts back from the end of the slice. The helper is protected against overflow errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Cut&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Slices collection around the first instance of separator, returning the part of collection before and after separator. The found result reports whether separator appears in collection. If separator does not appear in s, cut returns collection, empty slice of []T, false.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;actualLeft, actualRight, result = lo.Cut([]string{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"}, []string{"b", "c", "d"})

&lt;h3&gt;CutPrefix&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns collection without the provided leading prefix []T and reports whether it found the prefix. If s doesn't start with prefix, CutPrefix returns collection, false. If prefix is the empty []T, CutPrefix returns collection, true.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;actualRight, result = lo.CutPrefix([]string{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"}, []string{"a", "b", "c"})

&lt;h3&gt;CutSuffix&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns collection without the provided ending suffix []T and reports whether it found the suffix. If it doesn't end with suffix, CutSuffix returns collection, false. If suffix is the empty []T, CutSuffix returns collection, true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/ziB0V89IeVH"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Words&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Splits string into a slice of its words.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;str := lo.Words("helloWorld")
// []string{"hello", "world"}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/-f3VIQqiaVw"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Capitalize&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Converts the first character of string to upper case and the remaining to lower case.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;str := lo.Capitalize("heLLO")
// Hello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/uLTZZQXqnsa"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Ellipsis&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Trims and truncates a string to a specified length in &lt;code&gt;bytes&lt;/code&gt; and appends an ellipsis if truncated. If the string contains non-ASCII characters (which may occupy multiple bytes in UTF-8), truncating by byte length may split a character in the middle, potentially resulting in garbled output.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;str := lo.Ellipsis("  Lorem Ipsum  ", 5)
// Lo...

str := lo.Ellipsis("Lorem Ipsum", 100)
// Lorem Ipsum

str := lo.Ellipsis("Lorem Ipsum", 3)
// ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/qE93rgqe1TW"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;T2 -&amp;gt; T9&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Creates a tuple from a list of values.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;tuple1 := lo.T2("x", 1)
// Tuple2[string, int]{A: "x", B: 1}

func example() (string, int) { return "y", 2 }
tuple2 := lo.T2(example())
// Tuple2[string, int]{A: "y", B: 2}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/IllL3ZO4BQm"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Unpack2 -&amp;gt; Unpack9&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns values contained in a tuple.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;r1, r2 := lo.Unpack2(lo.Tuple2[string, int]{"a", 1})
// "a", 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Unpack is also available as a method of TupleX.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;tuple2 := lo.T2("a", 1)
a, b := tuple2.Unpack()
// "a", 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/xVP_k0kJ96W"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Zip2 -&amp;gt; Zip9&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Zip creates a slice of grouped elements, the first of which contains the first elements of the given slices, the second of which contains the second elements of the given slices, and so on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When collections are different sizes, the Tuple attributes are filled with zero value.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;tuples := lo.Zip2([]string{"a", "b"}, []int{1, 2})
// []Tuple2[string, int]{{A: "a", B: 1}, {A: "b", B: 2}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/jujaA6GaJTp"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;ZipBy2 -&amp;gt; ZipBy9&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;ZipBy creates a slice of transformed elements, the first of which contains the first elements of the given slices, the second of which contains the second elements of the given slices, and so on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When collections are different sizes, the Tuple attributes are filled with zero value.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;items := lo.ZipBy2([]string{"a", "b"}, []int{1, 2}, func(a string, b int) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s-%d", a, b)
})
// []string{"a-1", "b-2"}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Unzip2 -&amp;gt; Unzip9&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Unzip accepts a slice of grouped elements and creates a slice regrouping the elements to their pre-zip configuration.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;a, b := lo.Unzip2([]Tuple2[string, int]{{A: "a", B: 1}, {A: "b", B: 2}})
// []string{"a", "b"}
// []int{1, 2}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/ciHugugvaAW"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;UnzipBy2 -&amp;gt; UnzipBy9&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;UnzipBy2 iterates over a collection and creates a slice regrouping the elements to their pre-zip configuration.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;a, b := lo.UnzipBy2([]string{"hello", "john", "doe"}, func(str string) (string, int) {
    return str, len(str)
})
// []string{"hello", "john", "doe"}
// []int{5, 4, 3}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;CrossJoin2 -&amp;gt; CrossJoin9&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Combines every item from one list with every item from others. It is the cartesian product of lists received as arguments. Returns an empty list if a list is empty.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;result := lo.CrossJoin2([]string{"hello", "john", "doe"}, []int{1, 2})
// lo.Tuple2{"hello", 1}
// lo.Tuple2{"hello", 2}
// lo.Tuple2{"john", 1}
// lo.Tuple2{"john", 2}
// lo.Tuple2{"doe", 1}
// lo.Tuple2{"doe", 2}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;CrossJoinBy2 -&amp;gt; CrossJoinBy9&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Combines every item from one list with every item from others. It is the cartesian product of lists received as arguments. The project function is used to create the output values. Returns an empty list if a list is empty.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;result := lo.CrossJoinBy2([]string{"hello", "john", "doe"}, []int{1, 2}, func(a A, b B) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s - %d", a, b)
})
// "hello - 1"
// "hello - 2"
// "john - 1"
// "john - 2"
// "doe - 1"
// "doe - 2"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Duration&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns the time taken to execute a function.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;duration := lo.Duration(func() {
    // very long job
})
// 3s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/HQfbBbAXaFP"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Duration0 -&amp;gt; Duration10&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns the time taken to execute a function.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;duration := lo.Duration0(func() {
    // very long job
})
// 3s

err, duration := lo.Duration1(func() error {
    // very long job
    return errors.New("an error")
})
// an error
// 3s

str, nbr, err, duration := lo.Duration3(func() (string, int, error) {
    // very long job
    return "hello", 42, nil
})
// hello
// 42

// 3s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;ChannelDispatcher&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Distributes messages from input channels into N child channels. Close events are propagated to children.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Underlying channels can have a fixed buffer capacity or be unbuffered when cap is 0.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;ch := make(chan int, 42)
for i := 0; i &amp;lt;= 10; i++ {
    ch &amp;lt;- i
}

children := lo.ChannelDispatcher(ch, 5, 10, DispatchingStrategyRoundRobin[int])
// []&amp;lt;-chan int{...}

consumer := func(c &amp;lt;-chan int) {
    for {
        msg, ok := &amp;lt;-c
        if !ok {
            println("closed")

            break
        }

        println(msg)
    }
}

for i := range children {
    go consumer(children[i])
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/UZGu2wVg3J2"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many distributions strategies are available:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samber/lo/master/channel.go"&gt;lo.DispatchingStrategyRoundRobin&lt;/a&gt;: Distributes messages in a rotating sequential manner.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samber/lo/master/channel.go"&gt;lo.DispatchingStrategyRandom&lt;/a&gt;: Distributes messages in a random manner.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samber/lo/master/channel.go"&gt;lo.DispatchingStrategyWeightedRandom&lt;/a&gt;: Distributes messages in a weighted manner.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samber/lo/master/channel.go"&gt;lo.DispatchingStrategyFirst&lt;/a&gt;: Distributes messages in the first non-full channel.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samber/lo/master/channel.go"&gt;lo.DispatchingStrategyLeast&lt;/a&gt;: Distributes messages in the emptiest channel.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samber/lo/master/channel.go"&gt;lo.DispatchingStrategyMost&lt;/a&gt;: Distributes to the fullest channel.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some strategies bring fallback, in order to favor non-blocking behaviors. See implementations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For custom strategies, just implement the &lt;code&gt;lo.DispatchingStrategy&lt;/code&gt; prototype:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;type DispatchingStrategy[T any] func(message T, messageIndex uint64, channels []&amp;lt;-chan T) int
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Eg:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;type Message struct {
    TenantID uuid.UUID
}

func hash(id uuid.UUID) int {
    h := fnv.New32a()
    h.Write([]byte(id.String()))
    return int(h.Sum32())
}

// Routes messages per TenantID.
customStrategy := func(message string, messageIndex uint64, channels []&amp;lt;-chan string) int {
    destination := hash(message) % len(channels)

    // check if channel is full
    if len(channels[destination]) &amp;lt; cap(channels[destination]) {
        return destination
    }

    // fallback when child channel is full
    return utils.DispatchingStrategyRoundRobin(message, uint64(destination), channels)
}

children := lo.ChannelDispatcher(ch, 5, 10, customStrategy)
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;SliceToChannel&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns a read-only channel of collection elements. Channel is closed after last element. Channel capacity can be customized.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

for v := range lo.SliceToChannel(2, list) {
    println(v)
}
// prints 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, then 5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/lIbSY3QmiEg"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;ChannelToSlice&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns a slice built from channel items. Blocks until channel closes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;list := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
ch := lo.SliceToChannel(2, list)

items := ChannelToSlice(ch)
// []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Generator&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Implements the generator design pattern. Channel is closed after last element. Channel capacity can be customized.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;generator := func(yield func(int)) {
    yield(1)
    yield(2)
    yield(3)
}

for v := range lo.Generator(2, generator) {
    println(v)
}
// prints 1, then 2, then 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Buffer&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Creates a slice of n elements from a channel. Returns the slice, the slice length, the read time and the channel status (opened/closed).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;ch := lo.SliceToChannel(2, []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5})

items1, length1, duration1, ok1 := lo.Buffer(ch, 3)
// []int{1, 2, 3}, 3, 0s, true
items2, length2, duration2, ok2 := lo.Buffer(ch, 3)
// []int{4, 5}, 2, 0s, false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Example: RabbitMQ consumer 👇&lt;/p&gt;

    // do batching stuff

    if !ok {
        break
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;BufferWithContext&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Creates a slice of n elements from a channel, with timeout. Returns the slice, the slice length, the read time and the channel status (opened/closed).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.TODO())

&lt;h3&gt;BufferWithTimeout&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Creates a slice of n elements from a channel, with timeout. Returns the slice, the slice length, the read time and the channel status (opened/closed).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;generator := func(yield func(int)) {

&lt;h3&gt;FanIn&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Merge messages from multiple input channels into a single buffered channel. Output messages have no priority. When all upstream channels reach EOF, downstream channel closes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;stream1 := make(chan int, 42)
stream2 := make(chan int, 42)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;FanOut&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasts all the upstream messages to multiple downstream channels. When upstream channel reaches EOF, downstream channels close. If any downstream channels is full, broadcasting is paused.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;stream := make(chan int, 42)

all := lo.FanOut(5, 100, stream)
// [5]&amp;lt;-chan int

&lt;h3&gt;Contains&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns true if an element is present in a collection.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;present := lo.Contains([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 5)
// true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Every&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns true if all elements of a subset are contained in a collection or if the subset is empty.&lt;/p&gt;

// false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;EveryBy&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns true if the predicate returns true for all elements in the collection or if the collection is empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Some&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns true if at least 1 element of a subset is contained in a collection. If the subset is empty Some returns false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
### SomeBy

Returns true if the predicate returns true for any of the elements in the collection.
If the collection is empty SomeBy returns false.

```go
b := SomeBy([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int) bool {
    return x &amp;lt; 3
})
// true

&lt;h3&gt;None&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns true if no element of a subset is contained in a collection or if the subset is empty.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;b := None([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, []int{0, 2})
// false
b := None([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, []int{-1, 6})
// true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/fye7JsmxzPV"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;NoneBy&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns true if the predicate returns true for none of the elements in the collection or if the collection is empty.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;b := NoneBy([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}, func(x int) bool {
    return x &amp;lt; 0
})
// true

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/O64WZ32H58S"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Intersect&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns the intersection between two collections.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;result1 := lo.Intersect([]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, []int{0, 2})

&lt;h3&gt;NthOrEmpty&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns the element at index &lt;code&gt;nth&lt;/code&gt; of the collection. If &lt;code&gt;nth&lt;/code&gt; is negative, it returns the &lt;code&gt;nth&lt;/code&gt; element from the end. If &lt;code&gt;nth&lt;/code&gt; is out of slice bounds, it returns the zero value for the element type (e.g., 0 for integers, "" for strings, etc).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;nth := lo.NthOrEmpty([]int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, 2)
// 30

nth := lo.NthOrEmpty([]int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, -1)

nth := lo.NthOrEmpty([]int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, 5)
// 0 (zero value for int)

nth := lo.NthOrEmpty([]string{"apple", "banana", "cherry"}, 2)

// "" (zero value for string)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Sample&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns a random item from collection.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;lo.Sample([]string{"a", "b", "c"})
// a random string from []string{"a", "b", "c"}

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;import "math/rand"

r := rand.New(rand.NewSource(42))
lo.SampleBy([]string{"a", "b", "c"}, r.Intn)

lo.SampleBy([]string{}, r.Intn)
// ""
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Samples&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns N random unique items from collection.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;lo.Samples([]string{"a", "b", "c"}, 3)
// []string{"a", "b", "c"} in random order
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;SamplesBy&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Returns N random unique items from collection, using a given random integer generator.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;r := rand.New(rand.NewSource(42))

&lt;h3&gt;Ternary&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A single line if/else statement.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;result := lo.Ternary(true, "a", "b")
// "a"

result := lo.Ternary(false, "a", "b")
// "b"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Take care to avoid dereferencing potentially nil pointers in your A/B expressions, because they are both evaluated. See TernaryF to avoid this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;TernaryF&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A single line if/else statement whose options are functions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;result := lo.TernaryF(true, func() string { return "a" }, func() string { return "b" })
// "a"

result := lo.TernaryF(false, func() string { return "a" }, func() string { return "b" })
// "b"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Useful to avoid nil-pointer dereferencing in initializations, or avoid running unnecessary code&lt;/p&gt;

someStr := TernaryF(s == nil, func() string { return uuid.New().String() }, func() string { return *s })

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;count1, time1, err1 := lo.AttemptWhileWithDelay(5, time.Millisecond, func(i int, d time.Duration) (error, bool) {
    err := doMockedHTTPRequest(i)
    if err != nil {
        if errors.Is(err, ErrBadRequest) { // let's assume ErrBadRequest is a critical error that needs to terminate the invoke
            return err, false // flag the second return value as false to terminate the invoke
        }

        return err, true
    }

    return nil, false
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Debounce&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NewDebounce&lt;/code&gt; creates a debounced instance that delays invoking functions given until after wait milliseconds have elapsed, until &lt;code&gt;cancel&lt;/code&gt; is called.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;f := func() {
    println("Called once after 100ms when debounce stopped invoking!")
}

debounce, cancel := lo.NewDebounce(100 * time.Millisecond, f)
for j := 0; j &amp;lt; 10; j++ {
    debounce()
}

time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
cancel()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/mz32VMK2nqe"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;DebounceBy&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NewDebounceBy&lt;/code&gt; creates a debounced instance for each distinct key, that delays invoking functions given until after wait milliseconds have elapsed, until &lt;code&gt;cancel&lt;/code&gt; is called.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;f := func(key string, count int) {
    println(key + ": Called once after 100ms when debounce stopped invoking!")
}

debounce, cancel := lo.NewDebounceBy(100 * time.Millisecond, f)
for j := 0; j &amp;lt; 10; j++ {
    debounce("first key")
    debounce("second key")
}

time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
cancel("first key")
cancel("second key")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/d3Vpt6pxhY8"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Throttle&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Creates a throttled instance that invokes given functions only once in every interval.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This returns 2 functions, First one is throttled function and Second one is a function to reset interval.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;f := func() {
	println("Called once in every 100ms")
}

throttle, reset := lo.NewThrottle(100 * time.Millisecond, f)

for j := 0; j &amp;lt; 10; j++ {
	throttle()
	time.Sleep(30 * time.Millisecond)
}

reset()
throttle()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NewThrottleWithCount&lt;/code&gt; is NewThrottle with count limit, throttled function will be invoked count times in every interval.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;f := func() {
	println("Called three times in every 100ms")
}

throttle, reset := lo.NewThrottleWithCount(100 * time.Millisecond, f)

for j := 0; j &amp;lt; 10; j++ {
	throttle()
	time.Sleep(30 * time.Millisecond)
}

reset()
throttle()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NewThrottleBy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NewThrottleByWithCount&lt;/code&gt; are NewThrottle with sharding key, throttled function will be invoked count times in every interval.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;f := func(key string) {
	println(key, "Called three times in every 100ms")
}

throttle, reset := lo.NewThrottleByWithCount(100 * time.Millisecond, f)

for j := 0; j &amp;lt; 10; j++ {
	throttle("foo")
	time.Sleep(30 * time.Millisecond)
}

reset()
throttle()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Synchronize&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Wraps the underlying callback in a mutex. It receives an optional mutex.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;s := lo.Synchronize()

for i := 0; i &amp;lt; 10; i++ {
    go s.Do(func () {
        println("will be called sequentially")
    })
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is equivalent to:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;mu := sync.Mutex{}

func foobar() {
    mu.Lock()
    defer mu.Unlock()

    // ...
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Async&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Executes a function in a goroutine and returns the result in a channel.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;ch := lo.Async(func() error { time.Sleep(10 * time.Second); return nil })
// chan error (nil)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Async{0-&amp;gt;6}&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Executes a function in a goroutine and returns the result in a channel. For functions with multiple return values, the results will be returned as a tuple inside the channel. For functions without return, struct{} will be returned in the channel.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;ch := lo.Async0(func() { time.Sleep(10 * time.Second) })
// chan struct{}

ch := lo.Async1(func() int {
  time.Sleep(10 * time.Second);
  return 42
})
// chan int (42)

ch := lo.Async2(func() (int, string) {
  time.Sleep(10 * time.Second);
  return 42, "Hello"
})
// chan lo.Tuple2[int, string] ({42, "Hello"})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Transaction&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Implements a Saga pattern.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;transaction := NewTransaction().
    Then(
        func(state int) (int, error) {
            fmt.Println("step 1")
            return state + 10, nil
        },
        func(state int) int {
            fmt.Println("rollback 1")
            return state - 10
        },
    ).
    Then(

        func(state int) int {

            if true {
                return state, errors.New("error")
            }

            return state + 42, nil

&lt;h3&gt;WaitFor&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Runs periodically until a condition is validated.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;alwaysTrue := func(i int) bool { return true }
alwaysFalse := func(i int) bool { return false }
laterTrue := func(i int) bool {

&lt;h3&gt;WaitForWithContext&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Runs periodically until a condition is validated or context is invalid.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The condition receives also the context, so it can invalidate the process in the condition checker&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;ctx := context.Background()

alwaysTrue := func(_ context.Context, i int) bool { return true }
alwaysFalse := func(_ context.Context, i int) bool { return false }
laterTrue := func(_ context.Context, i int) bool {

iterations, duration, ok := lo.WaitForWithContext(ctx, alwaysFalse, 10*time.Millisecond, time.Millisecond)

iterations, duration, ok := lo.WaitForWithContext(ctx, laterTrue, 10*time.Millisecond, 5*time.Millisecond)
// 2

expiringCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 5*time.Millisecond)
iterations, duration, ok := lo.WaitForWithContext(expiringCtx, alwaysFalse, 100*time.Millisecond, time.Millisecond)
// 5
// 5.1ms

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/t_wTDmubbK3"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Validate&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Helper function that creates an error when a condition is not met.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;slice := []string{"a"}
val := lo.Validate(len(slice) == 0, "Slice should be empty but contains %v", slice)
// error("Slice should be empty but contains [a]")

slice := []string{}
val := lo.Validate(len(slice) == 0, "Slice should be empty but contains %v", slice)
// nil
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/vPyh51XpCBt"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Must&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Wraps a function call and panics if second argument is &lt;code&gt;error&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, returns the value otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;val := lo.Must(time.Parse("2006-01-02", "2022-01-15"))
// 2022-01-15

val := lo.Must(time.Parse("2006-01-02", "bad-value"))
// panics
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/TMoWrRp3DyC"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Must{0-&amp;gt;6}&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Must* has the same behavior as Must but returns multiple values.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;func example0() (error)
func example1() (int, error)
func example2() (int, string, error)
func example3() (int, string, time.Date, error)
func example4() (int, string, time.Date, bool, error)
func example5() (int, string, time.Date, bool, float64, error)
func example6() (int, string, time.Date, bool, float64, byte, error)

lo.Must0(example0())
val1 := lo.Must1(example1())    // alias to Must
val1, val2 := lo.Must2(example2())
val1, val2, val3 := lo.Must3(example3())
val1, val2, val3, val4 := lo.Must4(example4())
val1, val2, val3, val4, val5 := lo.Must5(example5())
val1, val2, val3, val4, val5, val6 := lo.Must6(example6())
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can wrap functions like &lt;code&gt;func (...) (..., ok bool)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;// math.Signbit(float64) bool
lo.Must0(math.Signbit(v))

// bytes.Cut([]byte,[]byte) ([]byte, []byte, bool)
before, after := lo.Must2(bytes.Cut(s, sep))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can give context to the panic message by adding some printf-like arguments.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;val, ok := lo.Find(myString, func(i string) bool {
    return i == requiredChar
})
lo.Must0(ok, "'%s' must always contain '%s'", myString, requiredChar)

list := []int{0, 1, 2}
item := 5
lo.Must0(lo.Contains(list, item), "'%s' must always contain '%s'", list, item)
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/TMoWrRp3DyC"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Try&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Calls the function and returns false in case of error and panic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;ok := lo.Try(func() error {
    panic("error")
    return nil
})
// false

ok := lo.Try(func() error {
    return nil
})
// true

ok := lo.Try(func() error {
    return errors.New("error")
})
// false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/mTyyWUvn9u4"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Try{0-&amp;gt;6}&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The same behavior as &lt;code&gt;Try&lt;/code&gt;, but the callback returns 2 variables.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;ok := lo.Try2(func() (string, error) {
    panic("error")
    return "", nil
})
// false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/mTyyWUvn9u4"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;TryOr&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Calls the function and return a default value in case of error and on panic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;str, ok := lo.TryOr(func() (string, error) {
    panic("error")
    return "hello", nil
}, "world")
// world
// false

str, ok := lo.TryOr(func() error {
    return "hello", nil
}, "world")
// hello
// true

str, ok := lo.TryOr(func() error {
    return "hello", errors.New("error")
}, "world")
// world
// false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/B4F7Wg2Zh9X"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;TryOr{0-&amp;gt;6}&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The same behavior as &lt;code&gt;TryOr&lt;/code&gt;, but the callback returns &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; variables.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;str, nbr, ok := lo.TryOr2(func() (string, int, error) {
    panic("error")
    return "hello", 42, nil
}, "world", 21)
// world
// 21
// false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/B4F7Wg2Zh9X"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;TryWithErrorValue&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The same behavior as &lt;code&gt;Try&lt;/code&gt;, but also returns the value passed to panic.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;err, ok := lo.TryWithErrorValue(func() error {
    panic("error")
    return nil
})
// "error", false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/Kc7afQIT2Fs"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;TryCatch&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The same behavior as &lt;code&gt;Try&lt;/code&gt;, but calls the catch function in case of error.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;caught := false

ok := lo.TryCatch(func() error {
    panic("error")
    return nil
}, func() {
    caught = true
})
// false
// caught == true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/PnOON-EqBiU"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;TryCatchWithErrorValue&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The same behavior as &lt;code&gt;TryWithErrorValue&lt;/code&gt;, but calls the catch function in case of error.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;caught := false

ok := lo.TryCatchWithErrorValue(func() error {
    panic("error")
    return nil
}, func(val any) {
    caught = val == "error"
})
// false
// caught == true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/8Pc9gwX_GZO"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;ErrorsAs&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A shortcut for:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;err := doSomething()

var rateLimitErr *RateLimitError
if ok := errors.As(err, &amp;amp;rateLimitErr); ok {

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;single line &lt;code&gt;lo&lt;/code&gt; helper:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;err := doSomething()

if rateLimitErr, ok := lo.ErrorsAs[*RateLimitError](err); ok {

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="https://go.dev/play/p/8wk5rH8UfrE"&gt;play&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Assert&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Does nothing when the condition is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise it panics with an optional message.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think twice before using it, given that &lt;a href="https://go.dev/doc/faq#assertions"&gt;Go intentionally omits assertions from its standard library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;age := getUserAge()

lo.Assert(age &amp;gt;= 15)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;age := getUserAge()

lo.Assert(age &amp;gt;= 15, "user age must be &amp;gt;= 15")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Assertf&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;code&gt;Assert&lt;/code&gt;, but with &lt;code&gt;fmt.Printf&lt;/code&gt;-like formatting.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Think twice before using it, given that &lt;a href="https://go.dev/doc/faq#assertions"&gt;Go intentionally omits assertions from its standard library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;🛩 Benchmark&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We executed a simple benchmark with a dead-simple &lt;code&gt;lo.Map&lt;/code&gt; loop:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See the full implementation &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samber/lo/master/map_benchmark_test.go"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-go"&gt;_ = lo.Map[int64](arr, func(x int64, i int) string {

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here is a comparison between &lt;code&gt;lo.Map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lop.Map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;go-funk&lt;/code&gt; library and a simple Go &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;lo.Map&lt;/code&gt; is way faster (x7) than &lt;code&gt;go-funk&lt;/code&gt;, a reflection-based Map implementation.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;lo.Map&lt;/code&gt; has the same allocation profile as &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;lo.Map&lt;/code&gt; is 4% slower than &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;lop.Map&lt;/code&gt; is slower than &lt;code&gt;lo.Map&lt;/code&gt; because it implies more memory allocation and locks. &lt;code&gt;lop.Map&lt;/code&gt; is useful for long-running callbacks, such as i/o bound processing.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; beats other implementations for memory and CPU.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExternalDNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This README is a part of the complete documentation, available &lt;a href="https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/external-dns/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;What It Does&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/dns"&gt;Kubernetes DNS&lt;/a&gt;, Kubernetes' cluster-internal DNS server, ExternalDNS makes Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers. Like KubeDNS, it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/api/"&gt;Kubernetes API&lt;/a&gt; to determine a desired list of DNS records. &lt;em&gt;Unlike&lt;/em&gt; KubeDNS, however, it's not a DNS server itself, but merely configures other DNS providers accordingly—e.g. &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/"&gt;AWS Route 53&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/"&gt;Google Cloud DNS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In a broader sense, ExternalDNS allows you to control DNS records dynamically via Kubernetes resources in a DNS provider-agnostic way.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/master/docs/faq.md"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; contains additional information and addresses several questions about key concepts of ExternalDNS.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To see ExternalDNS in action, have a look at this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HQ2XgL9YVI"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; or read this &lt;a href="https://codemine.be/posts/20190125-devops-eks-externaldns/"&gt;blogpost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The Latest Release&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/master/docs/release.md"&gt;current release process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;ExternalDNS allows you to keep selected zones (via &lt;code&gt;--domain-filter&lt;/code&gt;) synchronized with Ingresses and Services of &lt;code&gt;type=LoadBalancer&lt;/code&gt; and nodes in various DNS providers:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;ExternalDNS is, by default, aware of the records it is managing, therefore it can safely manage non-empty hosted zones. We strongly encourage you to set &lt;code&gt;--txt-owner-id&lt;/code&gt; to a unique value that doesn't change for the lifetime of your cluster. You might also want to run ExternalDNS in a dry run mode (&lt;code&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt; flag) to see the changes to be submitted to your DNS Provider API.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Note that all flags can be replaced with environment variables; for instance, &lt;code&gt;--dry-run&lt;/code&gt; could be replaced with &lt;code&gt;EXTERNAL_DNS_DRY_RUN=1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;New providers&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;No new provider will be added to ExternalDNS &lt;em&gt;in-tree&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;ExternalDNS has introduced a webhook system, which can be used to add a new provider. See PR #3063 for all the discussions about it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some known providers using webhooks are the ones in the table below.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: The maintainers of ExternalDNS have not reviewed those providers, use them at your own risk and following the license and usage recommendations provided by the respective projects. The maintainers of ExternalDNS take no responsibility for any issue or damage from the usage of any externally developed webhook.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/tbody&gt; 
&lt;/table&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Status of in-tree providers&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;ExternalDNS supports multiple DNS providers which have been implemented by the &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/graphs/contributors"&gt;ExternalDNS contributors&lt;/a&gt;. Maintaining all of those in a central repository is a challenge, which introduces lots of toil and potential risks.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This mean that &lt;code&gt;external-dns&lt;/code&gt; has begun the process to move providers out of tree. See #4347 for more details. Those who are interested can create a webhook provider based on an &lt;em&gt;in-tree&lt;/em&gt; provider and after submit a PR to reference it here.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We define the following stability levels for providers:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable&lt;/strong&gt;: Used for smoke tests before a release, used in production and maintainers are active.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beta&lt;/strong&gt;: Community supported, well tested, but maintainers have no access to resources to execute integration tests on the real platform and/or are not using it in production.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha&lt;/strong&gt;: Community provided with no support from the maintainers apart from reviewing PRs.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following table clarifies the current status of the providers according to the aforementioned stability levels:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;table&gt; 
 &lt;thead&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;th&gt;Provider&lt;/th&gt; 
   &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt; 
   &lt;th&gt;Maintainers&lt;/th&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/thead&gt; 
 &lt;tbody&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;Google Cloud DNS&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;Stable&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;AWS Route 53&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;Stable&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Running Locally&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/master/docs/contributing/dev-guide.md"&gt;contributor guide&lt;/a&gt; for details on compiling from source.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Setup Steps&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Next, run an application and expose it via a Kubernetes Service:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port=80
kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Annotate the Service with your desired external DNS name. Make sure to change &lt;code&gt;example.org&lt;/code&gt; to your domain.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;kubectl annotate service nginx "external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname=nginx.example.org."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Optionally, you can customize the TTL value of the resulting DNS record by using the &lt;code&gt;external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl&lt;/code&gt; annotation:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;kubectl annotate service nginx "external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=10"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For more details on configuring TTL, see &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/master/docs/advanced/ttl.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Use the internal-hostname annotation to create DNS records with ClusterIP as the target.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;kubectl annotate service nginx "external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/internal-hostname=nginx.internal.example.org."
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If the service is not of type Loadbalancer you need the --publish-internal-services flag.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Locally run a single sync loop of ExternalDNS.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service --once --dry-run
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This should output the DNS records it will modify to match the managed zone with the DNS records you desire. It also assumes you are running in the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; namespace. See the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/master/docs/faq.md"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; for more information regarding namespaces.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Note: TXT records will have the &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-id&lt;/code&gt; value embedded. Those are used to ensure that ExternalDNS is aware of the records it manages.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once you're satisfied with the result, you can run ExternalDNS like you would run it in your cluster: as a control loop, and &lt;strong&gt;not in dry-run&lt;/strong&gt; mode:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;external-dns --txt-owner-id my-cluster-id --provider google --google-project example-project --source service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Check that ExternalDNS has created the desired DNS record for your Service and that it points to its load balancer's IP. Then try to resolve it:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-console"&gt;dig +short nginx.example.org.
104.155.60.49
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Now you can experiment and watch how ExternalDNS makes sure that your DNS records are configured as desired. Here are a couple of things you can try out:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Change the desired hostname by modifying the Service's annotation.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Recreate the Service and see that the DNS record will be updated to point to the new load balancer IP.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Add another Service to create more DNS records.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Remove Services to clean up your managed zone.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;tutorials&lt;/strong&gt; section contains examples, including Ingress resources, and shows you how to set up ExternalDNS in different environments such as other cloud providers and alternative Ingress controllers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;Note&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If using a txt registry and attempting to use a CNAME the &lt;code&gt;--txt-prefix&lt;/code&gt; must be set to avoid conflicts. Changing &lt;code&gt;--txt-prefix&lt;/code&gt; will result in lost ownership over previously created records.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;externalIPs&lt;/code&gt; list is defined for a &lt;code&gt;LoadBalancer&lt;/code&gt; service, this list will be used instead of an assigned load balancer IP to create a DNS record. It's useful when you run bare metal Kubernetes clusters behind NAT or in a similar setup, where a load balancer IP differs from a public IP (e.g. with &lt;a href="https://metallb.universe.tf"&gt;MetalLB&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Are you interested in contributing to external-dns? We, the maintainers and community, would love your suggestions, contributions, and help! Also, the maintainers can be contacted at any time to learn more about how to get involved.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We also encourage ALL active community participants to act as if they are maintainers, even if you don't have "official" write permissions. This is a community effort, we are here to serve the Kubernetes community. If you have an active interest and you want to get involved, you have real power! Don't assume that the only people who can get things done around here are the "maintainers". We also would love to add more "official" maintainers, so show us what you can do!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The external-dns project is currently in need of maintainers for specific DNS providers. Ideally each provider would have at least two maintainers. It would be nice if the maintainers run the provider in production, but it is not strictly required.
