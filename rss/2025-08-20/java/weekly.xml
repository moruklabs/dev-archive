&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/EeT5Y3v.png" alt="banner" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;WARNING: THIS IS THE ONLY OFFICIAL DOWNLOAD SOURCE FOR AAAD. AAADAPK.COM, UPTODOWN, SOFTONIC etc. ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH AAAD IN ANY WAY.&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Please always download genuine softwares.&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Android Auto Apps Downloader (AAAD) is an app for Android Phones that downloads popular Android Auto 3rd party apps and installs them in the correct way to have them in Android Auto.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in 3 years, now users with &lt;strong&gt;non-rooted Android devices&lt;/strong&gt; can enjoy these apps made for Android Auto, and Android Auto Apps Downloader does it all for you. Simply select an app you want to install on your phone and the download will begin. Once completed, install the given app with the classic Android interface and you can start enjoying the app you’ve just downloaded on Android Auto.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;No need for a PC. No developer options. No need of grabbing APKs and patch them. No root needed&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;AAAD can be easily installed on any Android phone and the whole installing process takes place only on it. You will not need to activate developer settings, neither in main settings nor in Android Auto.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this app is having the listed apps in Android Auto with a pain free experience and, most of all, without requiring a rooted phone.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you are instead running a rooted device, you might want to consider the free alternative &lt;a href="https://github.com/shmykelsa/AA-Tweaker"&gt;AA AIO TWEAKER&lt;/a&gt;, which has an alternative root method to patch the apps and it has a lot of other cool features that you can activate or pre-activate on Android Auto!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;AAAD is free and offers in app purchases. The free version of the app allows up to 1 download every 30 days. With the PRO version you can enjoy the full experience and download as many times as you want, forever!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;🚨🚨‼‼ KNOWN ISSUES ‼‼🚨🚨&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oppo/Realme/OnePlus devices won't show apps or "No messages during drive"&lt;/strong&gt; - Please apply &lt;a href="https://github.com/shmykelsa/AAAD/wiki/Fix-for-OnePlus-Realme-Oppo"&gt;this fix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel: "No new messages during drive" - Android 13&lt;/strong&gt; - Please apply &lt;a href="https://github.com/shmykelsa/AAAD/wiki/Fix-for-Pixel-Android-13-"&gt;this fix&lt;/a&gt; before installing&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android 14+: Not compatible as of now, consider using &lt;a href="https://www.aawireless.io/"&gt;AAWireless USB Dongle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"This organization is currently ineligible to receive donations" - Please download AAAD only from this website, 3rd party downloads are not authorized, endorsed nor supported by our staff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GiroPay/Ideal/Przelewy24/Bancontact/EPS/Klarna Payment has not been recognized by the app - Please follow&lt;a href="mailto:help.aaad@gmail.com?subject=AAADSI&amp;amp;body=Hello%2C%0D%0A%0D%0Athis%20is%20a%20pre-formatted%20e-mail.%20Please%20DO%20NOT%20edit%20the%20subject%20above%20and%20modify%20the%20e-mail%20with%20the%20right%20details.%20After%20sending%20the%20e-mail%20you%20will%20receive%20instructions%20on%20how%20to%20activate%20from%20email%20help.aaad%2Bcanned.response%40gmail.com.%20Please%20also%20check%20spam%20folder%20if%20nothing%20came%20to%20you.%0D%0A%0D%0AMethod%20of%20payment%3A%0D%0ALast%20four%20(4)%20digits%20of%20the%20card%20used%20(if%20applicable)%3A%0D%0ADate%20(and%20time%20if%20possible)%3A%0D%0AFull%20name%3A%0D%0A%0D%0A"&gt; this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fermata Auto download shows "App not responding (wait or close)"&lt;/strong&gt; - Fermata is quite heavy to download and GitHub servers are not the easiest with downloads. Please keep pressing on "wait". If it does fail, select top menu, select help and contact us through the app describing the steps you take to reproduce the issue.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A factory reset wipes the license away&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="mailto:help.aaad@gmail.com?subject=PROWIPED&amp;amp;body=Hello%2C%0D%0A%0D%0Amy%20license%20was%20lost%20after%20a%20device%20reset.%0D%0A%0D%0AThe%20e-mail%20I%E2%80%99ve%20registered%20for%20my%20payment%20is%3A%20****MODIFY%20HERE****%0D%0A%0D%0ARegards%0D%0A%0D%0A%3E"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Protect erased the downloaded apps&lt;/strong&gt; - There's a deeper explanation &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shmykelsa/AAAD/main/#i-have-a-warning-from-google-play-protect-warning-me-about-your-app-is-this-app-a-malware"&gt;down here&lt;/a&gt;. Please take a depp look before proceeding with installing any app. The install button is usually hidden and the big blue button &lt;strong&gt;WILL NOT&lt;/strong&gt; install the app you've chosen. Please use the "Install anyway" button instead.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/shmykelsa/AAAD/releases"&gt;GO TO DOWNLOAD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Updates&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want to stay updated with development, you can check out the &lt;a href="https://t.me/AAADupdates"&gt;dedicated Telegram Channel&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to watch the repository with the banner on the top right, you will be notified via mail if AAAD gets updated (GitHub account needed)! Star us if you really think AAAD is a good software :)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;PRO version of the app can be activated directly and automatically inside the app and it will be bind to one device and the PRO or FREE version (including the date of next download) of the app will survive app uninstall.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;Notes&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Android Auto Apps Downloader &lt;strong&gt;does not grant&lt;/strong&gt; in any way that the provided apps available for installing will actually work on Android Auto. The installing method can fail anytime if Google applies changes to Android Auto. Any software installed by Android Auto Apps Downloader is provided "as it is" and no support can be given by me for malfunctioning apps or malfunctioning Android Auto.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;F.A.Q.&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;How can I have support for this app?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can contact help team through AAAD app (top right menu &amp;gt; "help"). We are a very small team working from Italy so please keep patience with us in case you write us over night!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;How do I obtain a license?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To get started, press the bottom text of the AAAD app.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Can I pay for a license outside the app?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sure you can. Feel free to &lt;a href="https://buy.stripe.com/14k5mQ3ih6l7dMs8ww"&gt;pay through Stripe&lt;/a&gt; or donate any amount (equal or bigger than the asking price - 3.50 EUR) &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=V666UVPT9C5CJ"&gt;via PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, and keep the donation receipt (bank statement, confirmation page, e-mail etc.). Then please &lt;a href="mailto:help.aaad@gmail.com?subject=%5BGW%5D&amp;amp;body=Please%20don%E2%80%99t%20modify%20the%20subject%20above%20and%20feel%20free%20to%20modify%20this%20body%20leaving%20a%20small%20thought.%20An%20automatic%20response%20will%20then%20guide%20you%20to%20the%20following%20steps%20%3A"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;) or write an e-mail to &lt;a href="mailto:help.aaad@gmail.com"&gt;help.aaad@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; and write "[GW]" in the subject, and be sure to include also a small thought :). An automatic reply will guide you to the stepts to take after.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;What will a license of AAAD give me?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The license for AAAD pro will give you access to unlimited downloads.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Do I have to buy a license to have the apps working while the vehicle is not parked?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;No. AAAD pro does only give access to unlimited downloads.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;I've downloaded the app "xxx" from AAAD but it's not working well. What can I do?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The best thing is to ask the app's developer as we do not offer support for the apps inside AAAD. The apps are provided "as-is", and being developed by someone else, nobody from AAAD will be able to give the proper technical support for them. As long as the app is listed on Android Auto, apart from the "No new messages during drive" bug, then AAAD is working just as designed. If your app is not listed at all or suffers from the "No new messages during drive" contact help through AAAD app (top right menu &amp;gt; "help").&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Why the heck do I need this app? Can’t I just install the apps by myslef?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Well yes, you could, but they would not appear in Android Auto. Since the beginning of 2018 the custom apps for Android Auto are blocked by Google, but AAAD installs them in a special way in order to actually see the apps on Android Auto. And no root is needed! Call it magic, if you will. If you have a rooted phone, check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/shmykelsa/AA-Tweaker"&gt;AA AIO TWEAKER&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;I have a warning from Google Play Protect warning me about your app! Is this app a malware?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;AAAD does not contain any malware, and neither the apps inside it. Google obviously doesn't like Android Auto modding because of driving security. If you want to avoid any warning you'd want to know that Google Play Protect does not really have any anti-virus feature, rather it just warns of apps that Google doesn't like because of various reasons (e.g. installing other apps like Google Play Store does or contain third party in app purchase system). You can safely disable it by heading into Google Play Store's settings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Why only these apps? Where is YouTube? Where is Netflix? Where is Instagram?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Not all apps are compatible with Android Auto. You can’t just pick an app and sledge-hammer it into Android Auto. As a rule of thumb, no app from Google Play Store will be ever included in AAAD (unless such app has a different APK distributed in another platform). Apps coming from the Play Store are automatically available on Android Auto. Obviously, Google allows only certain types of apps on its store (navigation, music, messages, VOIP). Whenever an app implements Android Auto as functionality, it can't be falling in a different category from the ones allowed by Google.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;AAAD includes basically almost every Android Auto app known to date, and the only responsibility of AAAD is to make them available in Android Auto. If you know for sure there's an app compatible with Android Auto that is not included in AAAD, write to &lt;a href="mailto:submit.aaad@gmail.com"&gt;submit.aaad@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;How do I update the apps installed from AAAD?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;AAAD will always download latest version of an app. If one of the apps that you've installed through AAAD gets an update, you can open AAAD and download the update. At the moment, there's no update checker, but I'm planning on making it!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Will you hold my bank account/credit card informations?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;No. All the details of payment are held by Stripe Inc. and not processed nor passed to myself in any way. Also, I don't really care.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Will this app be available on the Play Store?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;No. It is only officially distributed on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Has the license an expiration date?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;No. AAAD is not a subscription, and once a license is obtained you won't be charged anymore.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;What happens if I change my device?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can transfer a license with the feature "Transfer license" on the top right menu. The license will be crypted inside the device with a key that we will not hold in any way and the above method is the only way to move a license for AAAD pro.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;What happens if I uninstall AAAD?&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Nothing. The date for next download will not be impacted and neither your AAAD pro version.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;License&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Part of the source code of the app is shared so that changes can be implemented by whoever wants to do so for personal use, the full version of the software is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; free, and you are not allowed to redistirbute modified versions of it, neither as a free application, niether as a commercial product. If you are intending to do so please seek my explicit writing approval for doing so. However you are allowed to modify the software as you wish as long as the modified version is &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; ever used by yourself. For more informations &lt;a href="https://github.com/shmykelsa/AAAD/raw/main/LICENSE"&gt;please read the EULA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A browser automation framework and ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1 align="center"&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="https://selenium.dev"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/common/images/selenium_logo_mark_green.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Selenium" width="100" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Selenium &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;h3 align="center"&gt;Automates browsers. That's it!&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p align="center"&gt; &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#contributing"&gt;Contributing&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#installing"&gt;Installing&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#building"&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#developing"&gt;Developing&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#testing"&gt;Testing&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#documenting"&gt;Documenting&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#releasing"&gt;Releasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation. Selenium specifically provides an infrastructure for the &lt;a href="https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/"&gt;W3C WebDriver specification&lt;/a&gt; — a platform and language-neutral coding interface compatible with all major web browsers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who've generously donated thousands of hours in code development and upkeep.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This README is for developers interested in contributing to the project. For people looking to get started using Selenium, please check out our &lt;a href="https://selenium.dev/documentation/"&gt;User Manual&lt;/a&gt; for detailed examples and descriptions, and if you get stuck, there are several ways to &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/support/"&gt;Get Help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/actions/workflows/ci.yml"&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="CI" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/actions/workflows/ci-rbe.yml"&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/actions/workflows/ci-rbe.yml/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="CI - RBE" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/SeleniumHQ/selenium/total.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Releases downloads" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Please read &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/raw/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/a&gt; before submitting your pull requests.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Installing&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These are the requirements to create your own local dev environment to contribute to Selenium.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;All Platforms&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk"&gt;Bazelisk&lt;/a&gt;, a Bazel wrapper that automatically downloads the version of Bazel specified in &lt;code&gt;.bazelversion&lt;/code&gt; file and transparently passes through all command-line arguments to the real Bazel binary.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Java JDK version 17 or greater (e.g., &lt;a href="https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17"&gt;Java 17 Temurin&lt;/a&gt;) 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Set &lt;code&gt;JAVA_HOME&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to location of Java executable (the JDK not the JRE)&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;To test this, try running the command &lt;code&gt;javac&lt;/code&gt;. This command won't exist if you only have the JRE installed. If you're met with a list of command-line options, you're referencing the JDK properly.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;MacOS&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Xcode including the command-line tools. Install the latest version using: &lt;code&gt;xcode-select --install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Rosetta for Apple Silicon Macs. Add &lt;code&gt;build --host_platform=//:rosetta&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;.bazelrc.local&lt;/code&gt; file. We are working to make sure this isn't required in the long run.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Windows&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimevansmusic/"&gt;Jim Evans&lt;/a&gt; published a great article on &lt;a href="https://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2020/04/setting-up-windows-development.html"&gt;Setting Up a Windows Development Environment for the Selenium .NET Language Bindings&lt;/a&gt;; This article is out of date, but it includes more detailed descriptions and screenshots that some people might find useful.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;details&gt; 
 &lt;summary&gt;Click to see Current Windows Setup Requirements&lt;/summary&gt; 
 &lt;h4&gt;Option 1: Automatic Installation from Scratch&lt;/h4&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;This script will ensure a complete ready to execute developer environment. (nothing is installed or set that is already present unless otherwise prompted)&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;ol&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Open Powershell as an Administrator&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Execute: &lt;code&gt;Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force&lt;/code&gt; to allow running the script in the process&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Navigate to the directory you want to clone Selenium in, or the parent directory of an already cloned Selenium repo&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Download and execute this script in the powershell terminal: [scripts/dev-environment-setup.ps1]`&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
 &lt;h4&gt;Option 2: Manual Installation&lt;/h4&gt; 
 &lt;ol&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Allow running scripts in Selenium in general: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Enable Developer Mode: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModelUnlock" /t REG_DWORD /f /v "AllowDevelopmentWithoutDevLicense" /d "1"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href="https://www.msys2.org/"&gt;MSYS2&lt;/a&gt;, which is an alternative shell environment that provides Unix-like commands 
   &lt;ul&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;Add bin directory to &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable (e.g., &lt;code&gt;"C:\tools\msys64\usr\bin"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;bash.exe&lt;/code&gt; location as the &lt;code&gt;BAZEL_SH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable (e.g., &lt;code&gt;"C:\tools\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Install the latest version of &lt;a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/"&gt;Visual Studio Community&lt;/a&gt; 
   &lt;ul&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;Use the visual studio installer to modify and add the "Desktop development with C++" Workload&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;Add Visual C++ build tools installation directory location to &lt;code&gt;BAZEL_VC&lt;/code&gt; environment variable (e.g. &lt;code&gt;"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;Add Visual C++ Build tools version to &lt;code&gt;BAZEL_VC_FULL_VERSION&lt;/code&gt; environment variable (this can be discovered from the directory name in &lt;code&gt;"$BAZEL_VC\Tools\MSVC\&amp;lt;BAZEL_VC_FULL_VERSION&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Add support for long file names (bazel has a lot of nested directories that can exceed default limits in Windows) 
   &lt;ul&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;Enable Long Paths support with these 2 registry commands:&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor" /t REG_DWORD /f /v "DisableUNCCheck" /d "1"
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" /t REG_DWORD /f /v "LongPathsEnabled" /d "1"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
   &lt;ul&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;Allow Bazel to create short name versions of long file paths: &lt;code&gt;fsutil 8dot3name set 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;Set bazel output to &lt;code&gt;C:/tmp&lt;/code&gt; instead of nested inside project directory: 
     &lt;ul&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Create a file &lt;code&gt;selenium/.bazelrc.windows.local&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
      &lt;li&gt;Add "startup --output_user_root=C:/tmp" to the file&lt;/li&gt; 
     &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/details&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Alternative Dev Environments&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want to contribute to the project, but do not want to set up your own local dev environment, there are two alternatives available.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Using GitPod&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Rather than creating your own local dev environment, GitPod provides a ready to use environment for you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium"&gt;&lt;img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Open in Gitpod" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Using Dev Container&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative you can build a &lt;a href="https://containers.dev/"&gt;Dev Container&lt;/a&gt; - basically a docker container - suitable for building and testing Selenium using the devcontainer.json in the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json"&gt;.devcontainer&lt;/a&gt; directory. Supporting IDEs like VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA should point you to how such a container can be created.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Using Docker Image&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can also build a Docker image suitable for building and testing Selenium using the Dockerfile in the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/scripts/dev-image/Dockerfile"&gt;dev image&lt;/a&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Building&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Selenium is built using a common build tool called &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/"&gt;Bazel&lt;/a&gt;, to allow us to easily manage dependency downloads, generate required binaries, build and release packages, and execute tests; all in a fast, efficient manner. For a more detailed discussion, read Simon Stewart's article on &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/building-selenium/"&gt;Building Selenium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Often we wrap Bazel commands with our custom &lt;a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/"&gt;Rake&lt;/a&gt; wrapper. These are run with the &lt;code&gt;./go&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The common Bazel commands are:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bazel build&lt;/code&gt; — evaluates dependencies, compiles source files and generates output files for the specified target. It's used to create executable binaries, libraries, or other artifacts.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bazel run&lt;/code&gt; — builds the target and then executes it. It's typically used for targets that produce executable binaries.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bazel test&lt;/code&gt; — builds and runs the target in a context with additional testing functionality&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bazel query&lt;/code&gt; — identifies available targets for the provided path.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each module that can be built is defined in a &lt;code&gt;BUILD.bazel&lt;/code&gt; file. To execute the module you refer to it starting with a &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;, then include the relative path to the file that defines it, then &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;, then the name of the target. For example, the target to build the Grid is named &lt;code&gt;executable-grid&lt;/code&gt; and it is defined in the &lt;code&gt;'selenium/java/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid/BAZEL.build'&lt;/code&gt; file. So to build the grid you would run: &lt;code&gt;bazel build //java/src/org/openqa/selenium/grid:executable-grid&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Bazel documentation has a &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/run/build#specifying-build-targets"&gt;handy guide&lt;/a&gt; for various shortcuts and all the ways to build multiple targets, which Selenium makes frequent use of.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To build everything for a given language:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;bazel build //&amp;lt;language&amp;gt;/...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To build just the grid there is an alias name to use (the log will show where the output jar is located):&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;bazel build grid
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To make things more simple, building each of the bindings is available with this &lt;code&gt;./go&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;./go &amp;lt;language&amp;gt;:build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Developing&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Java&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;IntelliJ&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Most of the team uses Intellij for their day-to-day editing. If you're working in IntelliJ, then we highly recommend installing the &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8609-bazel"&gt;Bazel IJ plugin&lt;/a&gt; which is documented on &lt;a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8609-bazel"&gt;its own site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To use Selenium with the IntelliJ Bazel plugin, import the repository as a Bazel project, and select the project view file from the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/scripts"&gt;scripts&lt;/a&gt; directory. &lt;code&gt;ij.bazelproject&lt;/code&gt; for Mac/Linux and &lt;code&gt;ij-win.bazelproject&lt;/code&gt; for Windows.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Linting&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We also use Google Java Format for linting, so using the Google Java Formatter Plugin is useful; there are a few steps to get it working, so read their &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/google-java-format/raw/master/README.md#intellij-jre-config"&gt;configuration documentation&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an auto-formatting script that can be run: &lt;code&gt;./scripts/format.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Local Installation&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While Selenium is not built with Maven, you can build and install the Selenium pieces for Maven to use locally by deploying to your local maven repository (&lt;code&gt;~/.m2/repository&lt;/code&gt;), using:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;./go java:install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Updating Dependencies&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dependencies are defined in the file &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/raw/trunk/MODULE.bazel"&gt;MODULE.bazel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To update a dependency, modify the version in the &lt;code&gt;MODULE.bazel&lt;/code&gt; file and run:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_REPIN=1 bazel run @maven//:pin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To automatically update and pin new dependencies, run:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;./go java:update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Python&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Linting and Formatting&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We follow the &lt;a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008"&gt;PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code&lt;/a&gt; (except we use a 120 character line length). This is checked and enforced with &lt;a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/"&gt;ruff&lt;/a&gt;, a linting/formatting tool. There is also an auto-formatting script that can be run: &lt;code&gt;./scripts/format.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Local Installation&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To run Python code locally without building/installing the package, you must first install the dependencies:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;pip install -r py/requirements.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then, build the generated files and copy them into your local source tree:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;./go py:local_dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After that, you can import the selenium package directly from source from the &lt;code&gt;py&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead of running from source, you can build and install the selenium package (wheel) locally:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;./go py:install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This will attempt to install into the global Python &lt;code&gt;site-packages&lt;/code&gt; directory, which might not be writable. To avoid this, you should create and activate a &lt;a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments"&gt;virtual environment&lt;/a&gt; before installing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Ruby&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;, you can create an interactive REPL with all gems loaded using: &lt;code&gt;bazel run //rb:console&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want to debug code, you can do it via &lt;a href="https://github.com/ruby/debug"&gt;&lt;code&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gem:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;binding.break&lt;/code&gt; to the code where you want the debugger to start.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Run tests with &lt;code&gt;ruby_debug&lt;/code&gt; configuration: &lt;code&gt;bazel test --config ruby_debug &amp;lt;test&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;When debugger starts, run the following in a separate terminal to connect to debugger:&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;bazel-selenium/external/bundle/bin/rdbg -A
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/"&gt;RubyMine&lt;/a&gt; for development, you can configure it use Bazel artifacts:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;rb/&lt;/code&gt; as a main project directory.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake update&lt;/code&gt; as necessary to create up-to-date artifacts. If this does not work, run &lt;code&gt;./go rb:update&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;selenium&lt;/code&gt; (parent) directory.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;In &lt;kbd&gt;Settings / Languages &amp;amp; Frameworks / Ruby SDK and Gems&lt;/kbd&gt; add new &lt;kbd&gt;Interpreter&lt;/kbd&gt; pointing to &lt;code&gt;../bazel-selenium/external/rules_ruby_dist/dist/bin/ruby&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;You should now be able to run and debug any spec. It uses Chrome by default, but you can alter it using environment variables specified in &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#ruby-2"&gt;Ruby Testing&lt;/a&gt; section below.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Rust&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To keep &lt;code&gt;Carbo.Bazel.lock&lt;/code&gt; synchronized with &lt;code&gt;Cargo.lock&lt;/code&gt;, run:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN=true bazel sync --only=crates
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of bazel configurations specific for testing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Common Options Examples&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Here are examples of arguments we make use of in testing the Selenium code:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--pin_browsers&lt;/code&gt; - run specific browser versions defined in the build (versions are updated regularly)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--headless&lt;/code&gt; - run browsers in headless mode (supported be Chrome, Edge and Firefox)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--flaky_test_attempts 3&lt;/code&gt; - re-run failed tests up to 3 times&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--local_test_jobs 1&lt;/code&gt; - control parallelism of tests&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--cache_test_results=no&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-t-&lt;/code&gt; - disable caching of test results and re-runs all of them&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--test_output all&lt;/code&gt; - print all output from the tests, not just errors&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--test_output streamed&lt;/code&gt; - run all tests one by one and print its output immediately&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--test_env FOO=bar&lt;/code&gt; - pass extra environment variable to test process&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--run_under="xvfb-run -a"&lt;/code&gt; - prefix to insert before the execution&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Filtering&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Selenium tests can be filtered by size:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;small — typically unit tests where no browser is opened&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;large — typically tests that actually drive a browser&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;medium — tests that are more involved than simple unit tests, but not fully driving a browser&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These can be filtered using the &lt;code&gt;test_size_filters&lt;/code&gt; argument like this:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;bazel test //&amp;lt;language&amp;gt;/... --test_size_filters=small
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tests can also be filtered by tag like:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;bazel test //&amp;lt;language&amp;gt;/... --test_tag_filters=this,-not-this
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If there are multiple &lt;code&gt;--test_tag_filters&lt;/code&gt;, only the last one is considered, so be careful if also using an inherited config&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;code&gt;--test_env&lt;/code&gt; to pass in the browser name as &lt;code&gt;SELENIUM_BROWSER&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;bazel test //javascript/selenium-webdriver:all --test_env=SELENIUM_BROWSER=firefox

   &lt;/tr&gt; 
   &lt;tr&gt; 
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;bazel test //rb/spec/unit/...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
    &lt;td&gt;Run unit tests&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;/tr&gt; 
   &lt;tr&gt; 
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;bazel test //rb/spec/... --test_size_filters large&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
    &lt;td&gt;Run integration tests for all browsers&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;/tr&gt; 
   &lt;tr&gt; 
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;bazel test //rb/spec/integration/...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
    &lt;td&gt;Run integration tests for all browsers&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;/tr&gt; 
   &lt;tr&gt; 
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;bazel test //rb/spec/integration/... --test_tag_filters firefox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
    &lt;td&gt;Run integration tests for local Firefox only&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td&gt;Run integration tests for local and remote Firefox&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;/tbody&gt; 
 &lt;/table&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Ruby test targets have the same name as the spec file with &lt;code&gt;_spec.rb&lt;/code&gt; removed, so you can run them individually. Integration tests targets also have a browser and remote suffix to control which browser to pick and whether to use Grid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;safari-preview&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#common-options-examples"&gt;Common Options Examples&lt;/a&gt;, here are some additional Ruby specific ones:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--test_arg "-eTimeouts"&lt;/code&gt; - test only specs which name include "Timeouts"&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--test_arg "&amp;lt;any other RSpec argument&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt; - pass any extra RSpec arguments (see &lt;code&gt;bazel run @bundle//bin:rspec -- --help&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Supported environment variables for use with &lt;code&gt;--test_env&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WD_SPEC_DRIVER&lt;/code&gt; - the driver to test; either the browser name or 'remote' (gets set by Bazel)&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WD_REMOTE_BROWSER&lt;/code&gt; - when &lt;code&gt;WD_SPEC_DRIVER&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;remote&lt;/code&gt;; the name of the browser to test (gets set by Bazel)&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WD_REMOTE_URL&lt;/code&gt; - URL of an already running server to use for remote tests&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DOWNLOAD_SERVER&lt;/code&gt; - when &lt;code&gt;WD_REMOTE_URL&lt;/code&gt; not set; whether to download and use most recently released server version for remote tests&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; - turns on verbose debugging&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;HEADLESS&lt;/code&gt; - for chrome, edge and firefox; runs tests in headless mode&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DISABLE_BUILD_CHECK&lt;/code&gt; - for chrome and edge; whether to ignore driver and browser version mismatches (allows testing Canary builds)&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CHROME_BINARY&lt;/code&gt; - path to test specific Chrome browser&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CHROMEDRIVER_BINARY&lt;/code&gt; - path to test specific ChromeDriver&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;EDGE_BINARY&lt;/code&gt; - path to test specific Edge browser&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;MSEDGEDRIVER_BINARY&lt;/code&gt; - path to test specific msedgedriver&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FIREFOX_BINARY&lt;/code&gt; - path to test specific Firefox browser&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GECKODRIVER_BINARY&lt;/code&gt; - path to test specific GeckoDriver&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To run with a specific version of Ruby you can change the version in &lt;code&gt;rb/.ruby-version&lt;/code&gt; or from command line:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;echo '&amp;lt;X.Y.Z&amp;gt;' &amp;gt; rb/.ruby-version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;/details&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;.NET&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;details&gt; 
 &lt;summary&gt;Click to see .NET Test Commands&lt;/summary&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;.NET tests currently only work with pinned browsers, so make sure to include that.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Run all tests with:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;bazel test //dotnet/test/common:AllTests --pin_browsers=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;You can run specific tests by specifying the class name:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;bazel test //dotnet/test/common:ElementFindingTest --pin_browsers=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If the module supports multiple browsers:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;bazel test //dotnet/test/common:ElementFindingTest-edge --pin_browsers=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;/details&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Rust&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;details&gt; 
 &lt;summary&gt;Click to see Rust Test Commands&lt;/summary&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Rust tests are run with:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;bazel test //rust/...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;/details&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Linux&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;details&gt; 
 &lt;summary&gt;Click to see Linux Testing Requirements&lt;/summary&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;By default, Bazel runs these tests in your current X-server UI. If you prefer, you can alternatively run them in a virtual or nested X-server.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;ol&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Run the X server &lt;code&gt;Xvfb :99&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Xnest :99&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Run a window manager, for example, &lt;code&gt;DISPLAY=:99 jwm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Run the tests you are interested in:&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ol&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;bazel test --test_env=DISPLAY=:99 //java/... --test_tag_filters=chrome
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;An easy way to run tests in a virtual X-server is to use Bazel's &lt;code&gt;--run_under&lt;/code&gt; functionality:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bazel test --run_under="xvfb-run -a" //java/...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;/details&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Documenting&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;API documentation can be found here:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/dotnet/"&gt;C#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/index.html"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/rb/"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To update API documentation for a specific language: &lt;code&gt;./go &amp;lt;language&amp;gt;:docs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To update all documentation: &lt;code&gt;./go all:docs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Releasing&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The full process for doing a release can be found in &lt;a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Releasing-Selenium"&gt;the wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Releasing is a combination of building and publishing, which often requires coordination of multiple executions and additional processing. As discussed in the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/trunk/#building"&gt;Building&lt;/a&gt; section, we use Rake tasks with the &lt;code&gt;./go&lt;/code&gt; command for these things. These &lt;code&gt;./go&lt;/code&gt; commands include the &lt;code&gt;--stamp&lt;/code&gt; argument to provide necessary information about the constructed asset.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can build and release everything with:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;./go all:release
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To build and release a specific language:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;./go &amp;lt;language&amp;gt;:release
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you have access to the Selenium EngFlow repository, you can have the assets built remotely and downloaded locally using:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;./go all:release['--config', 'release']
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OWASP dependency-check is a software composition analysis utility that detects publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in application dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.owasp/dependency-check-maven"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.owasp/dependency-check-maven.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Maven Central" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck/actions/workflows/build.yml"&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Build and Deploy Snapshot" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/dependencycheck"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/coverity/scan/1654.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Coverity Scan Build Status" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.codacy.com/app/jeremylong/DependencyCheck?utm_source=github.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=jeremylong/DependencyCheck&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade"&gt;&lt;img src="https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/6b6021d481dc41a888c5da0d9ecf9494" alt="Codacy Badge" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/843"&gt;&lt;img src="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/843/badge" alt="CII Best Practices" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-blue.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Apache 2.0 License" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-18/arsenal.html#jeremy-long"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toolswatch/badges/master/arsenal/usa/2018.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Black Hat Arsenal" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-15/arsenal.html#jeremy-long"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toolswatch/badges/master/arsenal/usa/2015.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Black Hat Arsenal" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-14/arsenal.html#Long"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toolswatch/badges/master/arsenal/usa/2014.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Black Hat Arsenal" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-13/arsenal.html#Long"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toolswatch/badges/master/arsenal/usa/2013.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Black Hat Arsenal" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;Dependency-Check&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dependency-Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project's dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Documentation and links to production binary releases can be found on the &lt;a href="https://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck"&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, more information about the architecture and ways to extend dependency-check can be found on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck/wiki"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Notice&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This product uses the NVD API but is not endorsed or certified by the NVD.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking Changes in 11.0.0&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Java 11 is now required to run dependency-check 11.0.0 or higher&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;H2 database upgrade&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;11.0.0 contains breaking changes using the local H2 database. A full download of the NVD data will occur. Note that if you are using a shared data directory the h2 database file is not compatible with older versions of dependency-check. If you run into problems you may need to run a purge:&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;gradle: &lt;code&gt;./gradlew dependencyCheckPurge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;maven: &lt;code&gt;mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:9.0.0:purge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;cli: &lt;code&gt;dependency-check.sh --purge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Mandatory Upgrade Notice&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrading to 10.0.2 or later is mandatory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Older versions of dependency-check are causing numerous, duplicative requests that end in processing failures are causing unnecassary load on the NVD API. Dependency-check 10.0.2 uses an updated &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; header that will allow the NVD to block calls from the older client.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;NVD API Key Highly Recommended&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dependency-check has moved from using the NVD data-feed to the NVD API. Users of dependency-check are &lt;strong&gt;highly&lt;/strong&gt; encouraged to obtain an NVD API Key; see &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key"&gt;https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key&lt;/a&gt; Without an NVD API Key dependency-check's updates will be &lt;strong&gt;extremely slow&lt;/strong&gt;. Please see the documentation for the cli, maven, gradle, or ant integrations on how to set the NVD API key.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;The NVD API Key, CI, and Rate Limiting&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The NVD API has enforced rate limits. If you are using a single API KEY and multiple builds occur you could hit the rate limit and receive 403 errors. In a CI environment one must use a caching strategy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Gradle build Environment&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With 9.0.0 users may encounter issues with &lt;code&gt;NoSuchMethodError&lt;/code&gt; exceptions due to dependency resolution. If you encounter this issue you will need to pin some of the transitive dependencies of dependency-check to specific versions. For example:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;/buildSrc/build.gradle&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-groovy"&gt;dependencies {
    constraints {
        // org.owasp.dependencycheck needs at least this version of jackson. Other plugins pull in older versions..
        add("implementation", "com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom:2.16.1")

        // org.owasp.dependencycheck needs these versions. Other plugins pull in older versions..
        add("implementation", "org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.14.0")
        add("implementation", "org.apache.commons:commons-text:1.11.0")
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Java Version&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Minimum Java Version: Java 11&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Internet Access&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;OWASP dependency-check requires access to several externally hosted resources. For more information see &lt;a href="https://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/data/index.html"&gt;Internet Access Required&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Build Tools&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In order to analyze some technology stacks dependency-check may require other development tools to be installed. Some of the analysis listed below may be experimental and require the experimental analyzers to be enabled.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;To analyze .NET Assemblies the dotnet 8 run time or SDK must be installed. 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;Assemblies targeting other run times can be analyzed - but 8 is required to run the analysis.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;If analyzing GoLang projects &lt;code&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; must be installed.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The analysis of &lt;code&gt;Elixir&lt;/code&gt; projects requires &lt;code&gt;mix_audit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The analysis of &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pnpm&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; projects requires &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pnpm&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;yarn&lt;/code&gt; to be installed. 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;The analysis performed utilize the respective &lt;code&gt;audit&lt;/code&gt; feature of each.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The analysis of Ruby is a wrapper around &lt;code&gt;bundle-audit&lt;/code&gt;, which must be installed.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Current Releases&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Jenkins Plugin&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For instructions on the use of the Jenkins plugin please see the &lt;a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/OWASP+Dependency-Check+Plugin"&gt;OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Command Line&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;More detailed instructions can be found on the &lt;a href="https://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-cli/"&gt;dependency-check github pages&lt;/a&gt;. The latest CLI can be downloaded from github in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck/releases"&gt;releases section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Downloading the latest release:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ VERSION=$(curl -s https://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/current.txt)
$ curl -Ls "https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck/releases/download/v$VERSION/dependency-check-$VERSION-release.zip" --output dependency-check.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On *nix&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ./bin/dependency-check.sh -h
$ ./bin/dependency-check.sh --out . --scan [path to jar files to be scanned]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On Windows&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; .\bin\dependency-check.bat -h
&amp;gt; .\bin\dependency-check.bat --out . --scan [path to jar files to be scanned]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On Mac with &lt;a href="http://brew.sh"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; Note - homebrew users upgrading from 5.x to 6.0.0 will need to run &lt;code&gt;dependency-check.sh --purge&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ brew update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; brew install dependency-check
$ dependency-check -h
$ dependency-check --out . --scan [path to jar files to be scanned]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Maven Plugin&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;More detailed instructions can be found on the &lt;a href="https://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-maven"&gt;dependency-check-maven github pages&lt;/a&gt;. By default, the plugin is tied to the &lt;code&gt;verify&lt;/code&gt; phase (i.e. &lt;code&gt;mvn verify&lt;/code&gt;). Alternatively, one can directly invoke the plugin via &lt;code&gt;mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The dependency-check plugin can be configured using the following:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-xml"&gt;&amp;lt;project&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;build&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt;
            ...
            &amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.owasp&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;dependency-check-maven&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;
                      &amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;
                          &amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;check&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;
                      &amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;
                  &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;
            ...
        &amp;lt;/plugins&amp;gt;
        ...
    &amp;lt;/build&amp;gt;
    ...
&amp;lt;/project&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Gradle Plugin&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For instructions on the use of the Gradle Plugin, please see the &lt;a href="https://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-gradle"&gt;dependency-check-gradle github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Ant Task&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For instructions on the use of the Ant Task, please see the &lt;a href="https://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-ant"&gt;dependency-check-ant github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Development Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For installation to pass, you must have the following components installed:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Java: &lt;code&gt;java -version&lt;/code&gt; 11.0&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Maven: &lt;code&gt;mvn -version&lt;/code&gt; 3.6.3 and higher&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tests cases require:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;dotnet core version 8.0&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Go: &lt;code&gt;go version&lt;/code&gt; 1.12 and higher&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Ruby &lt;a href="https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit#install"&gt;bundler-audit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/"&gt;Yarn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pnpm.io/installation"&gt;pnpm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Development Usage&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The following instructions outline how to compile and use the current snapshot. While every intention is to maintain a stable snapshot it is recommended that the release versions listed above be used.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The repository has some large files due to test resources. The team has tried to clean up the history as much as possible. However, it is recommended that you perform a shallow clone to save yourself time:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On *nix&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mvn -s settings.xml install
$ ./cli/target/release/bin/dependency-check.sh -h
$ ./cli/target/release/bin/dependency-check.sh --out . --scan ./src/test/resources
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On Windows&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; mvn -s settings.xml install
&amp;gt; .\cli\target\release\bin\dependency-check.bat -h
&amp;gt; .\cli\target\release\bin\dependency-check.bat --out . --scan ./src/test/resources
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Then load the resulting 'dependency-check-report.html' into your favorite browser.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Building without running tests&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To speed up your turnaround cycle times, you can also compile without running the tests each time:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;code&gt;mvn -s settings.xml install -DskipTests=true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to at least run the tests once before opening the PR. :)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;IntelliJ Idea&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To be able to debug your tests in IntelliJ Idea, you can introduce a maven configuration that executes your test and enables debugging with breakpoints etc.&lt;br /&gt; Basically, you do what´s described in &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-tests-in-maven.html#run_single_test"&gt;https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-tests-in-maven.html#run_single_test&lt;/a&gt; and set the &lt;code&gt;forkCount&lt;/code&gt; to 0, otherwise debugging won´t work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Step by step:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run -&amp;gt; Edit Configurations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ (Add new configuration) -&amp;gt; Maven&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Give the Configuration a name, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Run tests&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Choose working directory, e.g. &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;In &lt;code&gt;command line&lt;/code&gt;, enter &lt;code&gt;-DforkCount=0 -f pom.xml -s ../settings.xml test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;OK&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Run -&amp;gt; Debug&lt;/code&gt;, then choose the newly created run configuration&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ will now execute the test run for the &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt; subproject with enabled debugging. Breakpoints set anywhere in code should work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Only test one function or one class&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to speed up your turnaround cycle times, you can also just test one function or one test class.&lt;br /&gt; This works by adding &lt;code&gt;-Dtest=MyTestClass&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-Dtest=MyTestClass#myTestFunction&lt;/code&gt; to the run configuration. The complete command line in the run configuration then would be:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Dtest=MyTestClass#myTestFunction -DforkCount=0 -f pom.xml -s ../settings.xml test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Docker&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the following example it is assumed that the source to be checked is in the current working directory and the reports will be written to &lt;code&gt;$(pwd)/odc-reports&lt;/code&gt;. Persistent data and cache directories are used, allowing you to destroy the container after running.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For Linux:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;#!/bin/sh

DC_VERSION="latest"
DC_DIRECTORY=$HOME/OWASP-Dependency-Check
DC_PROJECT="dependency-check scan: $(pwd)"
DATA_DIRECTORY="$DC_DIRECTORY/data"
CACHE_DIRECTORY="$DC_DIRECTORY/data/cache"

if [ ! -d "$DATA_DIRECTORY" ]; then
    echo "Initially creating persistent directory: $DATA_DIRECTORY"
    mkdir -p "$DATA_DIRECTORY"
fi
if [ ! -d "$CACHE_DIRECTORY" ]; then
    echo "Initially creating persistent directory: $CACHE_DIRECTORY"
    mkdir -p "$CACHE_DIRECTORY"
fi

# Make sure we are using the latest version
docker pull owasp/dependency-check:$DC_VERSION

docker run --rm \
    -e user=$USER \
    -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
    --volume $(pwd):/src:z \
    --volume "$DATA_DIRECTORY":/usr/share/dependency-check/data:z \
    --volume $(pwd)/odc-reports:/report:z \
    owasp/dependency-check:$DC_VERSION \
    --scan /src \
    --format "ALL" \
    --project "$DC_PROJECT" \
    --out /report
    # Use suppression like this: (where /src == $pwd)
    # --suppression "/src/security/dependency-check-suppression.xml"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For Windows:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bat"&gt;@echo off

set DC_VERSION="latest"
set DC_DIRECTORY=%USERPROFILE%\OWASP-Dependency-Check
SET DC_PROJECT="dependency-check scan: %CD%"
set DATA_DIRECTORY="%DC_DIRECTORY%\data"
set CACHE_DIRECTORY="%DC_DIRECTORY%\data\cache"

IF NOT EXIST %DATA_DIRECTORY% (
    echo Initially creating persistent directory: %DATA_DIRECTORY%
    mkdir %DATA_DIRECTORY%
)
IF NOT EXIST %CACHE_DIRECTORY% (
    echo Initially creating persistent directory: %CACHE_DIRECTORY%
    mkdir %CACHE_DIRECTORY%
)

rem Make sure we are using the latest version
docker pull owasp/dependency-check:%DC_VERSION%

docker run --rm ^
    --volume %CD%:/src ^
    --volume %DATA_DIRECTORY%:/usr/share/dependency-check/data ^
    --volume %CD%/odc-reports:/report ^
    owasp/dependency-check:%DC_VERSION% ^

    --project "%DC_PROJECT%" ^
    --out /report
    rem Use suppression like this: (where /src == %CD%)
    rem --suppression "/src/security/dependency-check-suppression.xml"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Building From Source&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To build dependency-check (using Java 11) run the command:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mvn -s settings.xml install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Running dependency-check on dependency-check&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dependency-check references several vulnerable dependencies that are never used except as test resources. All of these optional test dependencies are included in the &lt;code&gt;test-dependencies&lt;/code&gt; profile. To run dependency-check against itself simple exclude the &lt;code&gt;test-dependencies&lt;/code&gt; profile:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:aggregate -P-test-dependencies -DskipProvidedScope=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Building the documentation&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The documentation on the &lt;a href="https://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/"&gt;github pages&lt;/a&gt; is generated from this repository:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mvn -s settings.xml site site:stage
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once done, point your browser to &lt;code&gt;./target/staging/index.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Building The Docker Image&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To build dependency-check docker image run the command:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mvn -s settings.xml install
./build-docker.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is Conductor?&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Conductor (or &lt;a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-conductor-a-microservices-orchestrator-2e8d4771bf40"&gt;Netflix Conductor&lt;/a&gt;) is a microservices orchestration engine for distributed and asynchronous workflows. It empowers developers to create workflows that define interactions between services, databases, and other external systems.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Conductor is designed to enable flexible, resilient, and scalable workflows. It allows you to compose services into complex workflows without coupling them tightly, simplifying orchestration across cloud-native applications and enterprise systems alike.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Key benefits&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience and Error Handling:&lt;/strong&gt; Conductor enables automatic retries and fallback mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability:&lt;/strong&gt; Built to scale with complex workflows in high-traffic environments.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observability:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides monitoring and debugging capabilities for workflows.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Seamlessly integrates with microservices, external APIs, and legacy systems.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workflow as code:&lt;/strong&gt; Define workflows in JSON and manage them with versioning.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich task types:&lt;/strong&gt; Includes task types like HTTP, JSON, Lambda, Sub Workflow, and Event tasks, allowing for flexible workflow definitions.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic workflow management:&lt;/strong&gt; Workflows can evolve independently of the underlying services.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built-in UI:&lt;/strong&gt; A customizable UI is available to monitor and manage workflows.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible persistence and queue options:&lt;/strong&gt; Use Redis, MySQL, Postgres, and more.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;hr /&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;Getting Started with Conductor&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Install Docker Desktop (&lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/"&gt;Windows/PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Install Java (JDK) 17 or newer&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Node 14 for the UI to build 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier versions may work, but are untested&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Start guide&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Clone the repo&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;git clone https://github.com/conductor-oss/conductor
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Change to new Conductor directory&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;cd conductor
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Start with Docker Compose (&lt;em&gt;recommended for local deployment&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Create your first workflow&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;With the UI:&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:8127"&gt;http://localhost:8127&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;Or the REST API with your preferred HTTP client:&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://localhost:8080"&gt;http://localhost:8080&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;Documentation&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Check-out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/conductor-oss/conductor/tree/main/docs"&gt;Conductor docs&lt;/a&gt; for additional details&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;hr /&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;Database Specifications&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The default persistence used is Redis&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;The indexing backend is &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/"&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; (7.x)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;To use &lt;a href="https://opensearch.org/"&gt;Opensearch&lt;/a&gt; (2.x), comment out Elasticsearch import so lucene dependencies don't conflict &lt;a href="https://github.com/conductor-oss/conductor/raw/main/server/build.gradle#L44-L46"&gt;server/build.gradle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

   &lt;th&gt;Backend&lt;/th&gt; 
   &lt;th&gt;Configuration&lt;/th&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
 &lt;/thead&gt; 
 &lt;tbody&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;Redis + ES7&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conductor-oss/conductor/main/docker/server/config/config-redis.properties"&gt;config-redis.properties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; 
  &lt;/tr&gt; 
  &lt;tr&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;Postgres&lt;/td&gt; 
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conductor-oss/conductor/main/docker/server/config/config-postgres.properties"&gt;config-postgres.properties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Termux - a terminal emulator application for Android OS extendible by variety of packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Termux application&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/actions"&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/workflows/Build/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Build status" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/actions"&gt;&lt;img src="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/workflows/Unit%20tests/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Testing status" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/termux/termux"&gt;&lt;img src="https://badges.gitter.im/termux/termux.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Join the chat at https://gitter.im/termux/termux" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/HXpF69X"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/discord/641256914684084234.svg?label=&amp;amp;logo=discord&amp;amp;logoColor=ffffff&amp;amp;color=5865F2" alt="Join the Termux discord server" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jitpack.io/#termux/termux-app"&gt;&lt;img src="https://jitpack.io/v/termux/termux-app.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Termux library releases at Jitpack" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://termux.com"&gt;Termux&lt;/a&gt; is an Android terminal application and Linux environment.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Note that this repository is for the app itself (the user interface and the terminal emulation). For the packages installable inside the app, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-packages"&gt;termux/termux-packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Quick how-to about Termux package management is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Package-Management"&gt;Package Management&lt;/a&gt;. It also has info on how to fix &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;repository is under maintenance or down&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; errors when running &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;pkg&lt;/code&gt; commands.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are looking for Termux Android application maintainers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;hr /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTICE: Termux may be unstable on Android 12+.&lt;/strong&gt; Android OS will kill any (phantom) processes greater than 32 (limit is for all apps combined) and also kill any processes using excessive CPU. You may get &lt;code&gt;[Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter]&lt;/code&gt; message in the terminal without actually exiting the shell process yourself. Check the related issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366"&gt;#2366&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/205156966"&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/Android-Docs/raw/master/en/docs/apps/processes/phantom-cached-and-empty-processes.md"&gt;phantom cached and empty processes docs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366#issuecomment-1237468220"&gt;this TLDR comment&lt;/a&gt; on how to disable trimming of phantom and excessive cpu usage processes. A proper docs page will be added later. An option to disable the killing should be available in Android 12L or 13, so upgrade at your own risk if you are on Android 11, specially if you are not rooted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Latest version is &lt;code&gt;v0.118.3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTICE: It is highly recommended that you update to &lt;code&gt;v0.118.0&lt;/code&gt; or higher ASAP for various bug fixes, including a critical world-readable vulnerability reported &lt;a href="https://termux.github.io/general/2022/02/15/termux-apps-vulnerability-disclosures.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/termux/termux-app/master/#google-play-store-experimental-branch"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt; for information regarding Termux on Google Play.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Termux can be obtained through various sources listed below for &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; Android &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;= 7&lt;/code&gt; with full support for apps and packages.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Support for both app and packages was dropped for Android &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/dnzdbs/end_of_android56_support_on_20200101/"&gt;2020-01-01&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;code&gt;v0.83&lt;/code&gt;, however it was re-added just for the app &lt;em&gt;without any support for package updates&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/2740"&gt;2022-05-24&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/termux/termux-app/master/#github"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; sources. Check &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-on-android-5-or-6"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the details.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The APK files of different sources are signed with different signature keys. The &lt;code&gt;Termux&lt;/code&gt; app and all its plugins use the same &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sharedUserId&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;com.termux&lt;/code&gt; and so all their APKs installed on a device must have been signed with the same signature key to work together and so they must all be installed from the same source. Do not attempt to mix them together, i.e do not try to install an app or plugin from &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; and another one from a different source like &lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt;. Android Package Manager will also normally not allow installation of APKs with different signatures and you will get errors on installation like &lt;code&gt;App not installed&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Failed to install due to an unknown error&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;INSTALL_FAILED_SHARED_USER_INCOMPATIBLE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;signatures do not match previously installed version&lt;/code&gt;, etc. This restriction can be bypassed with root or with custom roms.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to install from a different source, then you must &lt;strong&gt;uninstall any and all existing Termux or its plugin app APKs&lt;/strong&gt; from your device first, then install all new APKs from the same new source. Check &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/termux/termux-app/master/#uninstallation"&gt;Uninstallation&lt;/a&gt; section for details. You may also want to consider &lt;a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux"&gt;Backing up Termux&lt;/a&gt; before the uninstallation so that you can restore it after re-installing from Termux different source.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the following paragraphs, &lt;em&gt;"bootstrap"&lt;/em&gt; refers to the minimal packages that are shipped with the &lt;code&gt;termux-app&lt;/code&gt; itself to start a working shell environment. Its zips are built and released &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/releases"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;F-Droid&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Termux application can be obtained from &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; need to download the &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; app (via the &lt;code&gt;Download F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; link) to install Termux. You can download the Termux APK directly from the site by clicking the &lt;code&gt;Download APK&lt;/code&gt; link at the bottom of each version section.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It usually takes a few days (or even a week or more) for updates to be available on &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; once an update has been released on &lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; releases are built and published by &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; once they &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/com.termux.yml"&gt;detect&lt;/a&gt; a new &lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt; release. The Termux maintainers &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; have any control over the building and publishing of the Termux apps on &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt;. Moreover, the Termux maintainers also do not have access to the APK signing keys of &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; releases, so we cannot release an APK ourselves on &lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt; that would be compatible with &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; releases.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; app often may not notify you of updates and you will manually have to do a pull down swipe action in the &lt;code&gt;Updates&lt;/code&gt; tab of the app for it to check updates. Make sure battery optimizations are disabled for the app, check &lt;a href="https://dontkillmyapp.com/"&gt;https://dontkillmyapp.com/&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to do that.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Only a universal APK is released, which will work on all supported architectures. The APK and bootstrap installation size will be &lt;code&gt;~180MB&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;F-Droid&lt;/code&gt; does &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/1904"&gt;not support&lt;/a&gt; architecture specific APKs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;GitHub&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Termux application can be obtained on &lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt; either from &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases"&gt;&lt;code&gt;GitHub Releases&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for version &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;= 0.118.0&lt;/code&gt; or from &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/actions/workflows/debug_build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush"&gt;&lt;code&gt;GitHub Build Action&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; workflows. &lt;strong&gt;For android &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;= 7&lt;/code&gt;, only install &lt;code&gt;apt-android-7&lt;/code&gt; variants. For android &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;, only install &lt;code&gt;apt-android-5&lt;/code&gt; variants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The APKs for &lt;code&gt;GitHub Releases&lt;/code&gt; will be listed under &lt;code&gt;Assets&lt;/code&gt; drop-down of a release. These are automatically attached when a new version is released.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The APKs for &lt;code&gt;GitHub Build&lt;/code&gt; action workflows will be listed under &lt;code&gt;Artifacts&lt;/code&gt; section of a workflow run. These are created for each commit/push done to the repository and can be used by users who don't want to wait for releases and want to try out the latest features immediately or want to test their pull requests. Note that for action workflows, you need to be &lt;a href="https://github.com/login"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;logged into a &lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt; account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;Artifacts&lt;/code&gt; links to be enabled/clickable. If you are using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mobile"&gt;&lt;code&gt;GitHub&lt;/code&gt; app&lt;/a&gt;, then make sure to open workflow link in a browser like Chrome or Firefox that has your GitHub account logged in since the in-app browser may not be logged in.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The APKs for both of these are &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug"&gt;&lt;code&gt;debuggable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and are compatible with each other but they are not compatible with other sources.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Both universal and architecture specific APKs are released. The APK and bootstrap installation size will be &lt;code&gt;~180MB&lt;/code&gt; if using universal and &lt;code&gt;~120MB&lt;/code&gt; if using architecture specific. Check &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2153"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security warning&lt;/strong&gt;: APK files on GitHub are signed with a test key that has been &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/raw/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks"&gt;shared with community&lt;/a&gt;. This IS NOT an official developer key and everyone can use it to generate releases for own testing. Be very careful when using Termux GitHub builds obtained elsewhere except &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app"&gt;https://github.com/termux/termux-app&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone is able to use it to forge a malicious Termux update installable over the GitHub build. Think twice about installing Termux builds distributed via Telegram or other social media. If your device get caught by malware, we will not be able to help you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/raw/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks"&gt;test key&lt;/a&gt; shall not be used to impersonate @termux and can't be used for this anyway. This key is not trusted by us and it is quite easy to detect its use in user generated content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Google Play Store &lt;strong&gt;(Experimental branch)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is currently a build of Termux available on Google Play for Android 11+ devices, with extensive adjustments in order to pass policy requirements there. This is under development and has missing functionality and bugs (see &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux-play-store/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for status updates) compared to the stable F-Droid build, which is why most users who can should still use F-Droid or GitHub build as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Google Play will try to update installations away from F-Droid ones. Updating will still fail as &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element#uid"&gt;sharedUserId&lt;/a&gt; has been removed. A planned 0.118.1 F-Droid release will fix this by setting a higher version code than used for the PlayStore app. Meanwhile, to prevent Google Play from attempting to download and then fail to install the Google Play releases over existing installations, you can open the Termux apps pages on Google Play and then click on the 3 dots options button in the top right and then disable the Enable auto update toggle. However, the Termux apps updates will still show in the PlayStore app updates list.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help out with testing the Google Play build (or cannot install Termux from other sources), be aware that it's built from a separate repository (&lt;a href="https://github.com/termux-play-store/"&gt;https://github.com/termux-play-store/&lt;/a&gt;) - be sure to report issues &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux-play-store/termux-issues/issues/new/choose"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;, as any issues encountered might very well be specific to that repository.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Uninstallation&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Uninstallation may be required if a user doesn't want Termux installed in their device anymore or is switching to a different &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/termux/termux-app/master/#installation"&gt;install source&lt;/a&gt;. You may also want to consider &lt;a href="https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux"&gt;Backing up Termux&lt;/a&gt; before the uninstallation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To uninstall Termux completely, you must uninstall &lt;strong&gt;any and all existing Termux or its plugin app APKs&lt;/strong&gt; listed in &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/termux/termux-app/master/#termux-app-and-plugins"&gt;Termux App and Plugins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;Android Settings&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; and then look for those apps. You can also use the search feature if it’s available on your device and search &lt;code&gt;termux&lt;/code&gt; in the applications list.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even if you think you have not installed any of the plugins, it's strongly suggested to go through the application list in Android settings and double-check.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;iTerm 2: OS X terminal application. &lt;a href="https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues"&gt;Issues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation.html"&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt; (which includes &lt;a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-escape-codes.html"&gt;iTerm2 proprietary escape codes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;/details&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Debugging&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can help debug problems of the &lt;code&gt;Termux&lt;/code&gt; app and its plugins by setting appropriate &lt;code&gt;logcat&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Log Level&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Termux&lt;/code&gt; app settings -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;APP_NAME&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Debugging&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Log Level&lt;/code&gt; (Requires &lt;code&gt;Termux&lt;/code&gt; app version &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;= 0.118.0&lt;/code&gt;). The &lt;code&gt;Log Level&lt;/code&gt; defaults to &lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; and log level &lt;code&gt;Verbose&lt;/code&gt; currently logs additional information. Its best to revert log level to &lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; after you have finished debugging since private data may otherwise be passed to &lt;code&gt;logcat&lt;/code&gt; during normal operation and moreover, additional logging increases execution time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The plugin apps &lt;strong&gt;do not execute the commands themselves&lt;/strong&gt; but send execution intents to &lt;code&gt;Termux&lt;/code&gt; app, which has its own log level which can be set in &lt;code&gt;Termux&lt;/code&gt; app settings -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Termux&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Debugging&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Log Level&lt;/code&gt;. So you must set log level for both &lt;code&gt;Termux&lt;/code&gt; and the respective plugin app settings to get all the info.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Once log levels have been set, you can run the &lt;code&gt;logcat&lt;/code&gt; command in &lt;code&gt;Termux&lt;/code&gt; app terminal to view the logs in realtime (&lt;code&gt;Ctrl+c&lt;/code&gt; to stop) or use &lt;code&gt;logcat -d &amp;gt; logcat.txt&lt;/code&gt; to take a dump of the log. You can also view the logs from a PC over &lt;code&gt;ADB&lt;/code&gt;. For more information, check official android &lt;code&gt;logcat&lt;/code&gt; guide &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, users can generate termux files &lt;code&gt;stat&lt;/code&gt; info and &lt;code&gt;logcat&lt;/code&gt; dump automatically too with terminal's long hold options menu &lt;code&gt;More&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Report Issue&lt;/code&gt; option and selecting &lt;code&gt;YES&lt;/code&gt; in the prompt shown to add debug info. This can be helpful for reporting and debugging other issues. If the report generated is too large, then &lt;code&gt;Save To File&lt;/code&gt; option in context menu (3 dots on top right) of &lt;code&gt;ReportActivity&lt;/code&gt; can be used and the file viewed/shared instead.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Users must post complete report (optionally without sensitive info) when reporting issues. Issues opened with &lt;strong&gt;(partial) screenshots of error reports&lt;/strong&gt; instead of text will likely be automatically closed/deleted.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h5&gt;Log Levels&lt;/h5&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Off&lt;/code&gt; - Log nothing.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; - Start logging error, warn and info messages and stacktraces.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; - Start logging debug messages.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Verbose&lt;/code&gt; - Start logging verbose messages.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;For Maintainers and Contributors&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/termux/termux-app/master/termux-shared"&gt;termux-shared&lt;/a&gt; library was added in &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.109"&gt;&lt;code&gt;v0.109&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It defines shared constants and utils of the Termux app and its plugins. It was created to allow for the removal of all hardcoded paths in the Termux app. Some of the termux plugins are using this as well and rest will in future. If you are contributing code that is using a constant or a util that may be shared, then define it in &lt;code&gt;termux-shared&lt;/code&gt; library if it currently doesn't exist and reference it from there. Update the relevant changelogs as well. Pull requests using hardcoded values &lt;strong&gt;will/should not&lt;/strong&gt; be accepted. Termux app and plugin specific classes must be added under &lt;code&gt;com.termux.shared.termux&lt;/code&gt; package and general classes outside it. The &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/termux/termux-app/master/termux-shared/LICENSE.md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;termux-shared&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;LICENSE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; must also be checked and updated if necessary when contributing code. The licenses of any external library or code must be honoured.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The main Termux constants are defined by &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/raw/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;TermuxConstants&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; class. It also contains information on how to fork Termux or build it with your own package name. Changing the package name will require building the bootstrap zip packages and other packages with the new &lt;code&gt;$PREFIX&lt;/code&gt;, check &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Building-packages"&gt;Building Packages&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Check &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries"&gt;Termux Libraries&lt;/a&gt; for how to import termux libraries in plugin apps and &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries#forking-and-local-development"&gt;Forking and Local Development&lt;/a&gt; for how to update termux libraries for plugins.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;versionName&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; files of Termux and its plugin apps must follow the &lt;a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html"&gt;semantic version &lt;code&gt;2.0.0&lt;/code&gt; spec&lt;/a&gt; in the format &lt;code&gt;major.minor.patch(-prerelease)(+buildmetadata)&lt;/code&gt;. When bumping &lt;code&gt;versionName&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; files and when creating a tag for new releases on GitHub, make sure to include the patch number as well, like &lt;code&gt;v0.1.0&lt;/code&gt; instead of just &lt;code&gt;v0.1&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;build.gradle&lt;/code&gt; files and &lt;code&gt;attach_debug_apks_to_release&lt;/code&gt; workflow validates the version as well and the build/attachment will fail if &lt;code&gt;versionName&lt;/code&gt; does not follow the spec.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Commit Messages Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Commit messages &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; use the &lt;a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org"&gt;Conventional Commits&lt;/a&gt; spec so that chagelogs as per the &lt;a href="https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog"&gt;Keep a Changelog&lt;/a&gt; spec can automatically be generated by the &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/create-conventional-changelog"&gt;&lt;code&gt;create-conventional-changelog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; script, check its repo for further details on the spec. &lt;strong&gt;The first letter for &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; must be capital and description should be in the present tense.&lt;/strong&gt; The space after the colon &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; is necessary. For a breaking change, add an exclamation mark &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; before the colon &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;, so that it is highlighted in the chagelog automatically.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;[optional scope]: &amp;lt;description&amp;gt;

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only the &lt;code&gt;types&lt;/code&gt; listed below must be used exactly as they are used in the changelog headings.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, &lt;code&gt;Added: Add foo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Added|Fixed: Add foo and fix bar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Changed!: Change baz as a breaking change&lt;/code&gt;, etc. You can optionally add a scope as well, like &lt;code&gt;Fixed(terminal): Fix some bug&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Do not use anything else as type, like &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Added&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added&lt;/strong&gt; for new features.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changed&lt;/strong&gt; for changes in existing functionality.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deprecated&lt;/strong&gt; for soon-to-be removed features.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removed&lt;/strong&gt; for now removed features.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed&lt;/strong&gt; for any bug fixes.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; in case of vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Forking&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Check &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/raw/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java"&gt;&lt;code&gt;TermuxConstants&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; javadocs for instructions on what changes to make in the app to change package name.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;You also need to recompile bootstrap zip for the new package name. Check &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/For-maintainers#build-bootstrap-archives"&gt;building bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/1983"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2081#issuecomment-865280111"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Currently, not all plugins use &lt;code&gt;TermuxConstants&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;termux-shared&lt;/code&gt; library and have hardcoded &lt;code&gt;com.termux&lt;/code&gt; values and will need to be manually patched.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;If forking termux plugins, check &lt;a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries#forking-and-local-development"&gt;Forking and Local Development&lt;/a&gt; for info on how to use termux libraries for plugins.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The official home of the Presto distributed SQL query engine for big data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Presto&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Presto is a distributed SQL query engine for big data.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://prestodb.io/docs/current/installation.html"&gt;Presto installation documentation&lt;/a&gt; for deployment instructions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="https://prestodb.io/docs/current/"&gt;Presto documentation&lt;/a&gt; for general documentation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Mission and Architecture&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prestodb/presto/master/ARCHITECTURE.md"&gt;PrestoDB: Mission and Architecture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Mac OS X or Linux&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Java 17 64-bit. Both Oracle JDK and OpenJDK are supported.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Maven 3.6.3+ (for building)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Python 2.4+ (for running with the launcher script)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;details&gt; 
 &lt;!-- from: https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/README.md --&gt; 
 &lt;summary&gt;&lt;a id="building-presto"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building Presto&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/summary&gt; 
 &lt;h3&gt;Overview (Java)&lt;/h3&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Presto is a standard Maven project. Simply run the following command from the project root directory:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mvnw clean install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;On the first build, Maven will download all the dependencies from the internet and cache them in the local repository (&lt;code&gt;~/.m2/repository&lt;/code&gt;), which can take a considerable amount of time. Subsequent builds will be faster.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Presto has a comprehensive set of unit tests that can take several minutes to run. You can disable the tests when building:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After building Presto for the first time, you can load the project into your IDE and run the server. We recommend using &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;. Because Presto is a standard Maven project, you can import it into your IDE using the root &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; file. In IntelliJ, choose Open Project from the Quick Start box or choose Open from the File menu and select the root &lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;After opening the project in IntelliJ, double check that the Java SDK is properly configured for the project:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Open the File menu and select Project Structure&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;In the SDKs section, ensure that a distribution of JDK 17 is selected (create one if none exist)&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;In the Project section, ensure the Project language level is set to at least 8.0.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;When using JDK 17, an &lt;a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-201168"&gt;IntelliJ bug&lt;/a&gt; requires you to disable the &lt;code&gt;Use '--release' option for cross-compilation (Java 9 and later)&lt;/code&gt; setting in &lt;code&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Build, Execution, Deployment &amp;gt; Compiler &amp;gt; Java Compiler&lt;/code&gt;. If this option remains enabled, you may encounter errors such as: &lt;code&gt;package sun.misc does not exist&lt;/code&gt; because IntelliJ fails to resolve certain internal JDK classes.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Presto comes with sample configuration that should work out-of-the-box for development. Use the following options to create a run configuration:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Main Class: &lt;code&gt;com.facebook.presto.server.PrestoServer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;VM Options: &lt;code&gt;-ea -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M -XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent -Xmx2G -Dconfig=etc/config.properties -Dlog.levels-file=etc/log.properties -Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Working directory: &lt;code&gt;$MODULE_WORKING_DIR$&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$MODULE_DIR$&lt;/code&gt;(Depends your version of IntelliJ)&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Use classpath of module: &lt;code&gt;presto-main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The working directory should be the &lt;code&gt;presto-main&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory. In IntelliJ, using &lt;code&gt;$MODULE_DIR$&lt;/code&gt; accomplishes this automatically.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Hive plugin must be configured with location of your Hive metastore Thrift service. Add the following to the list of VM options, replacing &lt;code&gt;localhost:9083&lt;/code&gt; with the correct host and port (or use the below value if you do not have a Hive metastore):&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Dhive.metastore.uri=thrift://localhost:9083
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;h3&gt;Additional configuration for Java 17&lt;/h3&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When running with Java 17, additional &lt;code&gt;--add-opens&lt;/code&gt; flags are required to allow reflective access used by certain catalogs based on which catalogs are configured.&lt;br /&gt; For the default set of catalogs loaded when starting the Presto server in IntelliJ without changes, add the following flags to the &lt;strong&gt;VM Options&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;--add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang.ref=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.net=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.security=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/javax.security.auth=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/javax.security.auth.login=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.text=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.util.concurrent=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.util.concurrent.atomic=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/java.util.regex=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.loader=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.base/sun.security.action=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.security.jgss/sun.security.krb5=ALL-UNNAMED
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;These flags ensure that internal JDK modules are accessible at runtime for components used by Presto’s default configuration. It is not a comprehensive list. Additional flags may need to be added, depending on the catalogs configured on the server.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3&gt;Using SOCKS for Hive or HDFS&lt;/h3&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If your Hive metastore or HDFS cluster is not directly accessible to your local machine, you can use SSH port forwarding to access it. Setup a dynamic SOCKS proxy with SSH listening on local port 1080:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -v -N -D 1080 server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Then add the following to the list of VM options:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Dhive.metastore.thrift.client.socks-proxy=localhost:1080
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;h3&gt;Running the CLI&lt;/h3&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Start the CLI to connect to the server and run SQL queries:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;presto-cli/target/presto-cli-*-executable.jar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Run a query to see the nodes in the cluster:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM system.runtime.nodes;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;In the sample configuration, the Hive connector is mounted in the &lt;code&gt;hive&lt;/code&gt; catalog, so you can run the following queries to show the tables in the Hive database &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SHOW TABLES FROM hive.default;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;h3&gt;Building the Documentation&lt;/h3&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To build the Presto docs, see the &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prestodb/presto/master/presto-docs/README.md"&gt;docs README&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h3&gt;Building the Presto Console&lt;/h3&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;The Presto Console is composed of several React components and is written in JSX and ES6. This source code is stored in the &lt;code&gt;presto-ui/&lt;/code&gt; module. The compilation process generates browser-compatible javascript which is added as JAR resources during the maven build. When the resource JAR is included on the classpath of Presto coordinator, it will be able to serve the resources.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;None of the Java code relies on the Presto UI project being compiled, so it is possible to exclude this UI when building Presto. Add the property &lt;code&gt;-DskipUI&lt;/code&gt; to the maven command to disable building the &lt;code&gt;ui&lt;/code&gt; maven module.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./mvnw clean install -DskipUI
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;You must have &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/"&gt;Yarn&lt;/a&gt; installed to build the UI. When using Maven to build the project, Node and yarn are installed in the &lt;code&gt;presto-ui/target&lt;/code&gt; folder. Add the node and yarn executables to the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To update Presto Console after making changes, run:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn --cwd presto-ui/src install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To simplify iteration, you can also run in &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt; mode, which automatically re-compiles when changes to source files are detected:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;yarn --cwd presto-ui/src run watch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;To iterate quickly, simply re-build the project in IntelliJ after packaging is complete. Project resources will be hot-reloaded and changes are reflected on browser refresh.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h2&gt;Presto native and Velox&lt;/h2&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/prestodb/presto/tree/master/presto-native-execution"&gt;Presto native&lt;/a&gt; is a C++ rewrite of Presto worker. &lt;a href="https://github.com/prestodb/presto/tree/master/presto-native-execution"&gt;Presto native&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox"&gt;Velox&lt;/a&gt; as its primary engine to run presto workloads.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/velox"&gt;Velox&lt;/a&gt; is a C++ database library which provides reusable, extensible, and high-performance data processing components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;快速开始&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;如果你的设备有 Docker 环境，可以使用以下命令快速启动一个 Halo 的体验环境：&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;docker run -d --name halo -p 8090:8090 -v ~/.halo2:/root/.halo2 halohub/halo:2.21
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;或者点击下方按钮使用 &lt;a href="https://gitpod.io/"&gt;Gitpod&lt;/a&gt; 或 &lt;a href="https://template.us-west-1.run.claw.cloud/deploy?templateName=halo"&gt;ClawCloud Run&lt;/a&gt; 启动一个体验环境：&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/halo-sigs/gitpod-demo"&gt;&lt;img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Open in Gitpod" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://template.us-west-1.run.claw.cloud/deploy?templateName=halo"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClawCloud/Run-Template/refs/heads/main/Run-on-ClawCloud.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Run on ClawCloud" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;以上方式仅作为体验使用，推荐使用开源 Linux 服务器运维管理面板 &lt;a href="https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel"&gt;1Panel&lt;/a&gt; 进行部署（&lt;a href="https://docs.halo.run/getting-started/install/1panel"&gt;查看文档&lt;/a&gt;），轻松搞定反向代理、SSL 证书及升级备份任务。更多部署方式，请&lt;a href="https://docs.halo.run/category/%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97"&gt;查看文档&lt;/a&gt;。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;在线体验&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;环境地址：&lt;a href="https://demo.halo.run"&gt;https://demo.halo.run&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;后台地址：&lt;a href="https://demo.halo.run/console"&gt;https://demo.halo.run/console&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;用户名：&lt;code&gt;demo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;密码：&lt;code&gt;P@ssw0rd123..&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;专业版&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;相比于社区版，Halo 专业版为用户提供了大量增强功能及技术支持服务，增强功能包括短信验证码注册登录、全站私有化、LDAP 登录、三方账号登录及自定义 LOGO 等。 &lt;a href="https://www.lxware.cn/halo"&gt;点击查看专业版详细介绍&lt;/a&gt;。&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;生态&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;可访问 &lt;a href="https://www.halo.run/store/apps"&gt;官方应用市场&lt;/a&gt; 或 &lt;a href="https://github.com/halo-sigs/awesome-halo"&gt;awesome-halo 仓库&lt;/a&gt; 查看适用于 Halo 2.x 的主题和插件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Nacos: Dynamic &lt;em&gt;Na&lt;/em&gt;ming and &lt;em&gt;Co&lt;/em&gt;nfiguration &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;ervice&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gitter.im/alibaba/nacos?utm_source=badge&amp;amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pr-badge"&gt;&lt;img src="https://badges.gitter.im/alibaba/nacos.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Gitter" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-4EB1BA.svg?sanitize=true" alt="License" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/alibaba/nacos"&gt;&lt;img src="https://travis-ci.org/alibaba/nacos.svg?branch=master" alt="Gitter" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://opensource.alibaba.com/contribution_leaderboard/details?projectValue=nacos"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Nacos-Check%20Your%20Contribution-orange" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://deepwiki.com/alibaba/nacos"&gt;&lt;img src="https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Ask DeepWiki" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;hr /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;What does it do&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Nacos (official site: &lt;a href="https://nacos.io"&gt;nacos.io&lt;/a&gt;) is an easy-to-use platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration and service management. It helps you to build cloud native applications and microservices platform easily.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Service is a first-class citizen in Nacos. Nacos supports almost all type of services，for example，&lt;a href="https://nacos.io/docs/latest/ecology/use-nacos-with-dubbo/"&gt;Dubbo/gRPC service&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nacos.io/docs/latest/ecology/use-nacos-with-spring-cloud/"&gt;Spring Cloud RESTFul service&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://nacos.io/docs/latest/quickstart/quick-start-kubernetes/"&gt;Kubernetes service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Nacos provides four major functions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Discovery and Service Health Check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nacos makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. Nacos also provides real-time health checks of services to prevent sending requests to unhealthy hosts or service instances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Configuration Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dynamic Configuration Service allows you to manage configurations of all services in a centralized and dynamic manner across all environments. Nacos eliminates the need to redeploy applications and services when configurations are updated, which makes configuration changes more efficient and agile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic DNS Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nacos supports weighted routing, making it easier for you to implement mid-tier load balancing, flexible routing policies, flow control, and simple DNS resolution services in the production environment within your data center. It helps you to implement DNS-based service discovery easily and prevent applications from coupling to vendor-specific service discovery APIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service and MetaData Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nacos provides an easy-to-use service dashboard to help you manage your services metadata, configuration, kubernetes DNS, service health and metrics statistics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It is super easy to get started with your first project.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Deploying Nacos on cloud&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can deploy Nacos on cloud, which is the easiest and most convenient way to start Nacos.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Use the following &lt;a href="https://cn.aliyun.com/product/aliware/mse?spm=nacos-website.topbar.0.0.0"&gt;Nacos deployment guide&lt;/a&gt; to see more information and deploy a stable and out-of-the-box Nacos server.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Start by the provided startup package&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Step 1: Download the binary package&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can download the package from the &lt;a href="https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/releases"&gt;latest stable release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Take release &lt;code&gt;nacos-server-1.0.0.zip&lt;/code&gt; for example:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;unzip nacos-server-1.0.0.zip
cd nacos/bin 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h4&gt;Step 2: Start Server&lt;/h4&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;strong&gt;Linux/Unix/Mac&lt;/strong&gt; platform, run the following command to start server with standalone mode:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;sh startup.sh -m standalone
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt; platform, run the following command to start server with standalone mode. Alternatively, you can also double-click the &lt;code&gt;startup.cmd&lt;/code&gt; to run NacosServer.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;startup.cmd -m standalone
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For more details, see &lt;a href="https://nacos.io/docs/latest/quickstart/quick-start/"&gt;quick-start.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nacos.io/docs/latest/quickstart/quick-start/"&gt;Quick start with Nacos command and console&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nacos.io/docs/latest/ecology/use-nacos-with-dubbo/"&gt;Quick start with dubbo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nacos.io/docs/latest/ecology/use-nacos-with-spring-cloud/"&gt;Quick start with spring cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nacos.io/docs/latest/quickstart/quick-start-kubernetes/"&gt;Quick start with kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Apache Gravitino is a high-performance, geo-distributed, and federated metadata lake. It manages metadata directly in different sources, types, and regions, providing users with unified metadata access for data and AI assets.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/gravitino/main/docs/assets/gravitino-architecture.png" alt="Gravitino Architecture" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;🚀 Key Features&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unified Metadata Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Manage diverse metadata sources through a single model and API (e.g., Hive, MySQL, HDFS, S3).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-to-End Data Governance&lt;/strong&gt;: Features like access control, auditing, and discovery across all metadata assets.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Metadata Integration&lt;/strong&gt;: Changes in underlying systems are immediately reflected via Gravitino’s connectors.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geo-Distribution Support&lt;/strong&gt;: Share metadata across regions and clouds to support global architectures.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Engine Compatibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Seamlessly integrates with query engines without modifying SQL dialects.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Asset Management (WIP)&lt;/strong&gt;: Support for AI model and feature tracking.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;🌐 Common Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Federated metadata discovery across data lakes and data warehouses&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Multi-region metadata synchronization for hybrid or multi-cloud setups&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Data and AI asset governance with unified audit and access control&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Plug-and-play access for engines like Trino or Spark&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Support for evolving metadata standards, including AI model lineage&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;📚 Documentation&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The latest Gravitino documentation is available at &lt;a href="https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/latest/"&gt;gravitino.apache.org/docs/latest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This README provides a basic overview; visit the site for full installation, configuration, and development documentation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;🧪 Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Use Gravitino Playground (Recommended)&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gravitino provides a Docker Compose–based playground for a full-stack experience.&lt;br /&gt; Clone or download the &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/gravitino-playground"&gt;Gravitino Playground repository&lt;/a&gt; and follow its &lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/gravitino-playground/raw/main/README.md"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Run Gravitino Locally&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://gravitino.apache.org/downloads"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; and extract a binary release.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;conf/gravitino.conf&lt;/code&gt; to configure settings.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Start the server:&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;./bin/gravitino.sh start
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;ol start="4"&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;To stop:&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;./bin/gravitino.sh stop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;CTRL+C&lt;/code&gt; to stop.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;🧊 Iceberg REST Catalog&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gravitino provides a native Iceberg REST catalog service.&lt;br /&gt; See: &lt;a href="https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/latest/iceberg-rest-service/"&gt;Iceberg REST catalog service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;🔌 Trino Integration&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gravitino includes a Trino connector for federated metadata access.&lt;br /&gt; See: &lt;a href="https://gravitino.apache.org/docs/latest/trino-connector/index/"&gt;Using Trino with Gravitino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;🛠️ Building from Source&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gravitino uses Gradle. Windows is not currently supported.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Clean build without tests:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;./gradlew clean build -x test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Build a distribution:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;./gradlew compileDistribution -x test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Or compressed package:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;./gradlew assembleDistribution -x test
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Artifacts are output to the &lt;code&gt;distribution/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wrapper of &lt;a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing"&gt;Syncthing&lt;/a&gt; for Android. Head to the "releases" section or F-Droid for builds. I'm currently short on time. Please seek help on the forum and/or social media apps first before consuming my time moderating issues on the tracker here. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android/main/app/src/main/play/listings/en-US/graphics/phone-screenshots/1.png" alt="screenshot 1" width="200" /&gt; · &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android/main/app/src/main/play/listings/en-US/graphics/phone-screenshots/2.png" alt="screenshot 2" width="200" /&gt; · &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android/main/app/src/main/play/listings/en-US/graphics/phone-screenshots/4.png" alt="screenshot 3" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;I am no longer publishing this on Google Play&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://github.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android/raw/main/wiki/Switch-between-releases_Verify-APK-is-genuine.md"&gt;detailed info&lt;/a&gt; about release variants and which is recommended to fit your needs.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;"nel0x" has announced to continue publishing on the play store. I welcome his help and the work I think he'll put into &lt;a href="https://github.com/nel0x/syncthing-android-gplay"&gt;his mission&lt;/a&gt;. It's up to you, reading this, to decide if to trust and/or support him or go with the F-Droid release channel of this app instead. You don't know me and I don't know him... we are all volunteers in the spirit of open source.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Switching from the (now deprecated) official version&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Switching is easier than you may think!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;On Syncthing on the official app, go into the settings and create a backup.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Confirm you can see that backup in your files.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Now stop the official app entirely using the system app settings for Syncthing (force stop the app basically - we need to ensure it's not running).&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Install Syncthing-Fork &lt;a href="https://github.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android/releases/tag/v1.29.7.1"&gt;v1.29.7.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Now start Syncthing-Fork.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;In the Syncthing-Fork settings, restore the backup you created earlier.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Like magic, everything should be as it was in Syncthing official.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Confirm everything looks good.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Uninstall the official Syncthing app.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Delete the syncthing configuration backup from &lt;code&gt;backups/syncthing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Upgrade to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android/releases/latest"&gt;latest Syncthing-Fork version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Quickstart Guide&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Flink CDC provides a CdcUp CLI utility to start a playground environment and run Flink CDC jobs. You will need to have a working Docker and Docker compose environment to use it.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/apache/flink-cdc.git --depth=1&lt;/code&gt; to retrieve a copy of Flink CDC source code.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;cd tools/cdcup/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./cdcup.sh init&lt;/code&gt; to use the CdcUp tool to start a playground environment.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;./cdcup.sh up&lt;/code&gt; to boot-up docker containers, and wait for them to be ready.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;./cdcup.sh mysql&lt;/code&gt; to open a MySQL session, and create at least one table.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sql"&gt;-- initialize db and table
CREATE DATABASE cdc_playground;
USE cdc_playground;
CREATE TABLE test_table (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(32));

-- insert test data
INSERT INTO test_table VALUES (1, 'alice'), (2, 'bob'), (3, 'cicada'), (4, 'derrida');

-- verify if it has been successfully inserted
SELECT * FROM test_table;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;ol start="5"&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;./cdcup.sh pipeline pipeline-definition.yaml&lt;/code&gt; to submit the pipeline job. You may also edit the pipeline definition file for further configurations.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;./cdcup.sh flink&lt;/code&gt; to access the Flink Web UI.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Prepare a &lt;a href="https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/try-flink/local_installation/#starting-and-stopping-a-local-cluster"&gt;Apache Flink&lt;/a&gt; cluster and set up &lt;code&gt;FLINK_HOME&lt;/code&gt; environment variable.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/apache/flink-cdc/releases"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; Flink CDC tar, unzip it and put jars of pipeline connector to Flink &lt;code&gt;lib&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If you're using macOS or Linux, you may use &lt;code&gt;brew install apache-flink-cdc&lt;/code&gt; to install Flink CDC and compatible connectors quickly.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;ol start="3"&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;YAML&lt;/strong&gt; file to describe the data source and data sink, the following example synchronizes all tables under MySQL app_db database to Doris :&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-yaml"&gt; source:
   type: mysql
   hostname: localhost
   port: 3306
   username: root
   password: 123456
   tables: app_db.\.*

 sink:
   type: doris
   fenodes: 127.0.0.1:8030
   username: root
   password: ""

 transform:
   - source-table: adb.web_order01
     projection: \*, format('%S', product_name) as product_name
     filter: addone(id) &amp;gt; 10 AND order_id &amp;gt; 100
     description: project fields and filter
   - source-table: adb.web_order02
     projection: \*, format('%S', product_name) as product_name
     filter: addone(id) &amp;gt; 20 AND order_id &amp;gt; 200
     description: project fields and filter

 route:
   - source-table: app_db.orders
     sink-table: ods_db.ods_orders
   - source-table: app_db.shipments
     sink-table: ods_db.ods_shipments
   - source-table: app_db.products
     sink-table: ods_db.ods_products

 pipeline:
   name: Sync MySQL Database to Doris
   parallelism: 2
   user-defined-function:
     - name: addone
       classpath: com.example.functions.AddOneFunctionClass
     - name: format
       classpath: com.example.functions.FormatFunctionClass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;ol start="4"&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Submit pipeline job using &lt;code&gt;flink-cdc.sh&lt;/code&gt; script.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt; bash bin/flink-cdc.sh /path/mysql-to-doris.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;ol start="5"&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;View job execution status through Flink WebUI or downstream database.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚀 Native vectorized SQL engine:&lt;/strong&gt; StarRocks adopts vectorization technology to make full use of the parallel computing power of CPU, achieving sub-second query returns in multi-dimensional analyses, which is 5 to 10 times faster than previous systems.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;📊 Standard SQL:&lt;/strong&gt; StarRocks supports ANSI SQL syntax (fully supported TPC-H and TPC-DS). It is also compatible with the MySQL protocol. Various clients and BI software can be used to access StarRocks.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💡 Smart query optimization:&lt;/strong&gt; StarRocks can optimize complex queries through CBO (Cost Based Optimizer). With a better execution plan, the data analysis efficiency will be greatly improved.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⚡ Real-time update:&lt;/strong&gt; The updated model of StarRocks can perform upsert/delete operations according to the primary key, and achieve efficient query while concurrent updates.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🪟 Intelligent materialized view:&lt;/strong&gt; The materialized view of StarRocks can be automatically updated during the data import and automatically selected when the query is executed.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;✨ Querying data in data lakes directly&lt;/strong&gt;: StarRocks allows direct access to data from Apache Hive™, Apache Iceberg™, Delta Lake™ and Apache Hudi™ without importing.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🎛️ Resource management&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature allows StarRocks to limit resource consumption for queries and implement isolation and efficient use of resources among tenants in the same cluster.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;💠 Easy to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;: Simple architecture makes StarRocks easy to deploy, maintain and scale out. StarRocks tunes its query plan agilely, balances the resources when the cluster is scaled in or out, and recovers the data replica under node failure automatically.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Architecture Overview&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p align="center"&gt; &lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StarRocks/starrocks/main/images/arch.png" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;StarRocks’s streamlined architecture is mainly composed of two modules: Frontend (FE) and Backend (BE). The entire system eliminates single points of failure through seamless and horizontal scaling of FE and BE, as well as replication of metadata and data.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Starting from version 3.0, StarRocks supports a new shared-data architecture, which can provide better scalability and lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Customizable and privacy-conscious open-source keyboard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;HeliBoard&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;HeliBoard is a privacy-conscious and customizable open-source keyboard, based on AOSP / OpenBoard. Does not use internet permission, and thus is 100% offline.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/helium314.keyboard/"&gt;&lt;img src="https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="80" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/releases/latest"&gt;&lt;img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663460/26973090-f8fdc986-4d14-11e7-995a-e7c5e79ed925.png" alt="Get APK from GitHub" height="80" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/helium314.keyboard"&gt;&lt;img src="https://gitlab.com/IzzyOnDroid/repo/-/raw/master/assets/IzzyOnDroid.png" alt="Get it on IzzyOnDroid" height="80" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;Features&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Add dictionaries for suggestions and spell check&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;build your own, or get them &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries#dictionaries"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or in the &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries#experimental-dictionaries"&gt;experimental&lt;/a&gt; section (quality may vary)&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;additional dictionaries for emojis or scientific symbols can be used to provide suggestions (similar to "emoji search")&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;note that for Korean layouts, suggestions only work using &lt;a href="https://github.com/openboard-team/openboard/commit/83fca9533c03b9fecc009fc632577226bbd6301f"&gt;this dictionary&lt;/a&gt;, the tools in the dictionary repository are not able to create working dictionaries&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Customize keyboard themes (style, colors and background image)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;can follow the system's day/night setting on Android 10+ (and on some versions of Android 9)&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;can follow dynamic colors for Android 12+&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Customize keyboard &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/raw/main/layouts.md"&gt;layouts&lt;/a&gt; (only available when disabling &lt;i&gt;use system languages&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Customize special layouts, like symbols, number, or functional key layout&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Multilingual typing&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Glide typing (&lt;i&gt;only with closed source library&lt;/i&gt; ☹️)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;library not included in the app, as there is no compatible open source library available&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;can be extracted from GApps packages ("&lt;i&gt;swypelibs&lt;/i&gt;"), or downloaded &lt;a href="https://github.com/erkserkserks/openboard/tree/46fdf2b550035ca69299ce312fa158e7ade36967/app/src/main/jniLibs"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (click on the file and then "raw" or the tiny download button)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Clipboard history&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;One-handed mode&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Split keyboard&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Number pad&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Backup and restore your settings and learned word / history data&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Contributing ❤&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Reporting Issues&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whether you encountered a bug, or want to see a new feature in HeliBoard, you can contribute to the project by opening a new issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/issues"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Your help is always welcome!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Before opening a new issue, be sure to check the following:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the issue already exist?&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure a similar issue has not been reported by browsing &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/issues?q="&gt;existing issues&lt;/a&gt;. Please search open and closed issues.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the issue still relevant?&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure your issue is not already fixed in the latest version of HeliBoard.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it a single topic?&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to suggest multiple things, open multiple issues.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you use the issue template?&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to make life of our kind contributors easier by avoiding issues that miss key information to their resolution. Note that issues that that ignore part of the issue template will likely get treated with very low priority, as often they are needlessly hard to read or understand (e.g. huge screenshots, not providing a proper description, or addressing multiple topics). Blatant violation of the guidelines may result in the issue getting closed.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, you can read the following useful text about effective bug reporting (a bit longer read): &lt;a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html"&gt;https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Translations&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Translations can be added using &lt;a href="https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/heliboard/"&gt;Weblate&lt;/a&gt;. You will need an account to update translations and add languages. Add the language you want to translate to in Languages -&amp;gt; Manage translated languages in the top menu bar. Updating translations in a PR will not be accepted, as it may cause conflicts with Weblate translations.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some notes on translations&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;when translating metadata, translating the changelogs is rather useless. It's available as it was requested by translators.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;the &lt;code&gt;hidden_features_message&lt;/code&gt; is horrible to translate with Weblate, and serves little benefit as it's just a copy of what's already in the wiki: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/wiki/Hidden-functionality"&gt;https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/wiki/Hidden-functionality&lt;/a&gt;. It's been made available in the app on user request/contribution.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;To Community&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can share your themes, layouts and dictionaries with other people:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Themes can be saved and loaded using the menu on top-right in the &lt;em&gt;adjust colors&lt;/em&gt; screen 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;You can share custom colors in a separate &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/discussions/categories/custom-colors"&gt;discussion section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Custom keyboard layouts are text files whose content you can edit, copy and share 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;this applies to main keyboard layouts and to special layouts adjustable in advanced settings&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;see &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/main/layouts.md"&gt;layouts.md&lt;/a&gt; for details&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;You can share custom layouts in a separate &lt;a href="https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard/discussions/categories/custom-layout"&gt;discussion section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Creating dictionaries is a little more work 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;first you will need a wordlist, as described &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries/src/branch/main/wordlists/sample.combined"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the repository readme&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;the you need to compile the dictionary using &lt;a href="https://github.com/remi0s/aosp-dictionary-tools"&gt;external tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;the resulting file (and ideally the wordlist too) can be shared with other users&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;note that there will not be any further dictionaries added to this app, but you can add dictionaries to the &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/Helium314/aosp-dictionaries"&gt;dictionaries repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Supported Services&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;NewPipe currently supports these services:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;!-- We link to the service websites separately to avoid people accidentally opening a website they didn't want to. --&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;YouTube (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) and YouTube Music (&lt;a href="https://music.youtube.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;PeerTube (&lt;a href="https://joinpeertube.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) and all its instances (open the website to know what that means!) (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeerTube"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Bandcamp (&lt;a href="https://bandcamp.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandcamp"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;SoundCloud (&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundCloud"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;media.ccc.de (&lt;a href="https://media.ccc.de/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, NewPipe supports multiple video and audio services. Though it started off with YouTube, other people have added more services over the years, making NewPipe more and more versatile!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Partially due to circumstance, and partially due to its popularity, YouTube is the best supported out of these services. If you use or are familiar with any of these other services, please help us improve support for them! We're looking for maintainers for SoundCloud and PeerTube.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you intend to add a new service, please get in touch with us first! Our &lt;a href="https://teamnewpipe.github.io/documentation/"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; provide more information on how a new service can be added to the app and to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor"&gt;NewPipe Extractor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;NewPipe works by fetching the required data from the official API (e.g. PeerTube) of the service you're using. If the official API is restricted (e.g. YouTube) for our purposes, or is proprietary, the app parses the website or uses an internal API instead. This means that you don't need an account on any service to use NewPipe.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Also, since they are free and open source software, neither the app nor the Extractor use any proprietary libraries or frameworks, such as Google Play Services. This means you can use NewPipe on devices or custom ROMs that do not have Google apps installed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;Features&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;ul&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Watch videos at resolutions up to 4K&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Listen to audio in the background, only loading the audio stream to save data&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Popup mode (floating player, aka Picture-in-Picture)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Watch live streams&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Show/hide subtitles/closed captions&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Search videos and audios (on YouTube, you can specify the content language as well)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Enqueue videos (and optionally save them as local playlists)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Show/hide general information about videos (such as description and tags)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Show/hide next/related videos&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Show/hide comments&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Search videos, audios, channels, playlists and albums&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Browse videos and audios within a channel&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Subscribe to channels (yes, without logging into any account!)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Get notifications about new videos from channels you're subscribed to&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create and edit channel groups (for easier browsing and management)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Browse video feeds generated from your channel groups&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;View and search your watch history&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Search and watch playlists (these are remote playlists, which means they're fetched from the service you're browsing)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Create and edit local playlists (these are created and saved within the app, and have nothing to do with any service)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Download videos/audios/subtitles (closed captions)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Open in Kodi&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Watch/Block age-restricted material&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;!-- Hidden span to keep old links compatible. You should remove this span if you're translating the README into another language.--&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="updates"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Installation and updates&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can install NewPipe using one of the following methods:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Add our custom repo to F-Droid and install it from there. The instructions are here: &lt;a href="https://newpipe.net/FAQ/tutorials/install-add-fdroid-repo/"&gt;https://newpipe.net/FAQ/tutorials/install-add-fdroid-repo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Download the APK from &lt;a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases"&gt;GitHub Releases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/dev/#apk-info"&gt;compare the signing key&lt;/a&gt; and install it.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Update via F-Droid. This is the slowest method of getting updates, as F-Droid must recognize changes, build the APK itself, sign it, and then push the update to users.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Build a debug APK yourself. This is the fastest way to get new features on your device, but is much more complicated, so we recommend using one of the other methods.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;If you're interested in a specific feature or bugfix provided in a Pull Request in this repo, you can also download its APK from within the PR. Read the PR description for instructions. The great thing about PR-specific APKs is that they're installed side-by-side the official app, so you don't have to worry about losing your data or messing anything up.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We recommend method 1 for most users. APKs installed using method 1 or 2 are compatible with each other (meaning that if you installed NewPipe using either method 1 or 2, you can also update NewPipe using the other), but not with those installed using method 3. This is due to the same signing key (ours) being used for 1 and 2, but a different signing key (F-Droid's) being used for 3. Building a debug APK using method 4 excludes a key entirely. Signing keys help ensure that a user isn't tricked into installing a malicious update to an app. When using method 5, each APK is signed with a different random key supplied by GitHub Actions, so you cannot even update it. You will have to backup and restore the app data each time you wish to use a new APK.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, if you want to switch sources for some reason (e.g. NewPipe's core functionality breaks and F-Droid doesn't have the latest update yet), we recommend following this procedure:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Back up your data via Settings &amp;gt; Backup and Restore &amp;gt; Export Database so you keep your history, subscriptions, and playlists&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Uninstall NewPipe&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Download the APK from the new source and install it&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Import the data from step 1 via Settings &amp;gt; Backup and Restore &amp;gt; Import Database&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;[!Note] When you're importing a database into the official app, always make sure that it is the one you exported &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; the official app. If you import a database exported from an APK other than the official app, it may break things. Such an action is unsupported, and you should only do so when you're absolutely certain you know what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;h3&gt;APK Info&lt;/h3&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is the SHA fingerprint of NewPipe's signing key to verify downloaded APKs which are signed by us. The fingerprint is also available on &lt;a href="https://newpipe.net#download"&gt;NewPipe's website&lt;/a&gt;. This is relevant for method 2.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CB:84:06:9B:D6:81:16:BA:FA:E5:EE:4E:E5:B0:8A:56:7A:A6:D8:98:40:4E:7C:B1:2F:9E:75:6D:F5:CF:5C:AB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Contribution&lt;/h2&gt;

Type &lt;code&gt;#mine diamond_ore&lt;/code&gt; to mine diamond ore. Type &lt;code&gt;#stop&lt;/code&gt; to stop. For more, read &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cabaletta/baritone/1.19.4/USAGE.md"&gt;the usage page&lt;/a&gt; and/or watch this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwnJ1qsS7CoQl9Si-RTluuzCo_4Oulpa"&gt;tutorial playlist&lt;/a&gt;. Also try &lt;code&gt;#elytra&lt;/code&gt; for Elytra flying in the Nether using fireworks (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4bGGPo8yiHo"&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/NnSlQi-68eQ"&gt;usage&lt;/a&gt;).

For 1.16.5, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4eVJ9Qz2J8"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; and see description. Once Baritone is installed, look &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cabaletta/baritone/1.19.4/USAGE.md"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for instructions on how to use it. There's a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/CZkLXWo4Fg4"&gt;showcase video&lt;/a&gt; made by @Adovin#6313 on Baritone which I recommend.

&lt;p&gt;This project is an updated version of &lt;a href="https://github.com/leijurv/MineBot/"&gt;MineBot&lt;/a&gt;, the original version of the bot for Minecraft 1.8.9, rebuilt for 1.12.2 onwards. Baritone focuses on reliability and particularly performance (it's over &lt;a href="https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/pull/180#issuecomment-423822928"&gt;30x faster&lt;/a&gt; than MineBot at calculating paths).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;API&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The API is heavily documented, you can find the Javadocs for the latest release &lt;a href="https://baritone.leijurv.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Please note that usage of anything located outside of the &lt;code&gt;baritone.api&lt;/code&gt; package is not supported by the API release jar.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of basic usage for changing some settings, and then pathing to an X/Z goal.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-java"&gt;BaritoneAPI.getSettings().allowSprint.value = true;
BaritoneAPI.getSettings().primaryTimeoutMS.value = 2000L;

BaritoneAPI.getProvider().getPrimaryBaritone().getCustomGoalProcess().setGoalAndPath(new GoalXZ(10000, 20000));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;Can I use Baritone as a library in my custom utility client?&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;That's what it's for, sure! (As long as usage complies with the LGPL 3.0 License)&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;How is it so fast?&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Magic. (Hours of &lt;a href="https://github.com/leijurv/"&gt;leijurv&lt;/a&gt; enduring excruciating pain)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is it called Baritone?&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It's named for FitMC's deep sultry voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 &lt;li&gt;Easy to use, workflows can be created and managed via Web UI, &lt;a href="https://dolphinscheduler.apache.org/python/main/index.html"&gt;Python SDK&lt;/a&gt; or Open API&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Highly reliable and high availability, with a decentralized, multi-master and multi-worker architecture and native supports for horizontal scaling.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;High performance, its performance is several times faster than other orchestration platforms, and it is capable of handling tens of millions of tasks per day&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Cloud Native, DolphinScheduler supports orchestrating workflows cross multiple clouds and data centers, and allows custom task types&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Workflow Versioning, provides version control for both workflows and individual workflow instances, including tasks.&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Flexible state control of workflows and tasks, supports pause/stop/recover them in any time&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Multi-tenancy support&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt;Additional features, backfill support(Web UI native), permission control including project and data source etc.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;
